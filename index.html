                            <p> Today, nearly every business transaction starts with a Google Search. And whatever appears about you and your business on page one of Google is critical. One bad review on Facebook, Twitter, or a blog can wreck your brand and
                                your website rankings. Many businesses have tried to counter negative reviews or comments online and it has backfired in spectacular fashion. Eliminate bad reviews from aggregator sites, blogs, websites, and create appropriate

                        <p>Over The SEO Ninjas has done outstanding things for our business growth and our online presence. Prior to working with Over The Top, we attempted to run our own PPC campaigns with very low results (wasting a lot of money). After
                            bringing in Over The Top, who understands our needs and is very attentive, the phone is ringing off the hook. Thank you for helping us triple our profits! We give them the highest regard for their skill set and highly recommend
                            them for any company&#8217;s website building and online presence.</p>

                        <p>After hiring a few SEO firms over the years, with little to no results, I decided to give one more crack at it. I learned about Over The Top SEO while researching the best link building companies on google, and found myself stumbling
                            across their website. I was introduced to the founder, Guy Sheetrit, by one of his employees, and could immediately tell my experience would be different. Guy seems to have a knowledge of SEO that far surpasses that of 99%
                            of the SEO firms I&#8217;ve dealt with in the past, and the results speak for itself. I plan on using his services in the months to come.</p>

                        <p>Over The Top SEO chose a great name, because their results really are over the top. I worked out an estimated ROI I&#8217;d get from working with them, and the results have FAR exceeded what I thought I&#8217;d be getting. First
                            page results all over the place, ranking for wayyyyy more phrases than I was even expecting, and the traffic has turned into a game changing amount of new business for me and my company. Thank you guys sincerely!</p>

                        <p>We started working with Over The Top SEO after looking for serious SEO experts, we found them in the top positions for most of the competitive words we looked up and after much consideration we decided to go with them, We can&#8217;t
                            disclose too much but I can say that it is a beautiful relationship and we are most grateful for the technical knowledge these guys have. Overall just 10/10.</p>

                        <p>We are a fairly big company in the auto parts industry and Over The Top SEO helped us grow A LOT in the past 2 years. we would gladly recommend them anytime, anywhere.</p>

                        <p>This company is probably the best we have encountered as of yet, we have been suffering from poor &#8220;SEO&#8221; experts by 5 companies that are known out there and yet all fail to deliver and over promise the sky. With over
                            the top we literally had 100% interaction in our campaign, we were an active part of the process and still are always in the loop. We finally saw results after several short months with a continuing growth in sales. We are
                            so happy to have met Guy and his team of professionals, and we are not going anywhere.</p>

                        <p>We were very surprised by the way Guy, Greg, Paul and the team at Over the top SEO works, its the first time someone opens our eyes to what is happening with our campaigns and involves us deeply into the process, which now I understand
                            the importance of why they do it they way they do, we are with OTT for more than 9 months now and we are very happy with them, they are the only company that provided us with raw results constantly.</p>

                        <p>It sounds that I am very buyest, but hee, what these guys do works. On a daily basis you see your positions improve, traffic get better and your store grow. We are happy bumping into Over The Top SEO, even though we are a dutch
                            company they managed to get Gereedschappelijk the ranking we were looking for. And still improving&#8230;!

                    search,” “organic search,” or “earned search” results.

                        <p>
                            Search engines have always had rules. You must play by those rules. If you don’t — if you try to trick Google (you think) into ranking your site higher — you will get caught. And you will pay. Maybe not now, maybe not in 1 month but eventually Google
                            always finds SEO cheaters & troublemakers. By most accounts, they have about 900,000 servers in 16 data centers around the world. Google’s servers use around 260 million watts of electricity — about 0.01% of global energy use
                            — enough to power a city of 200,000 people. Google’s servers are always on, always crawling the web, and they will find you if your site doesn’t play by their rules. So, really now, instead of taking stupid risks with your
                            business which could directly affect your actual life, just do us all a favor and play by their rules. If you don’t know them, well… come see if you qualify so you don’t have to worry too much about that anymore.

                        <p> Many have tried to do SEO on their own and got “slapped” (penalized) by Google for breaking rules that change almost daily. Many of our current clients were, at some point, victims of Black-Hat SEOs who promised them lightning
                            fast results and just flooded the internet with thousands of spammy pages and worthless backlinks. You probably spent countless hours and wheelbarrows of money trying to rank, yet never saw an increase in web traffic. In other
                            cases, many pay good money to an SEO agency that merely implements cookie cutter SEO strategies and never really addresses their problems and, a few months later, leaves them right where they started. No matter what bad experiences
                            you’ve had with other SEO companies before, you’re not to blame (the first time), but shame on you for not doing your research. Now, the SEO rules have drastically changed, and you most likely WON’T have a 3rd chance. So, going
                            the black-hat way a 2nd time would be acting in a very irresponsible way towards yourself and your business. </p>

                        <p>In the digital marketing field, if you want to tell a clueless company apart from the rest, just wait to hear the first question out of their mouth. Nine times out of ten, it`ll be some version of “What&nbsp; does an SEO company

                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <h3>What does an SEO Company Do?</h3>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p><a href="seo-services.html">An SEO company like ours</a>? A hell of a lot, actually.</p>
                        <p>But before getting into the nitty-gritty of it all, it`s best to get the basics out of the way. As there are still plenty of business owners out there without a clear picture of what SEO actually is.</p>
                        <p>SEO stands for Search Engine Optimization and refers to the discipline of establishing, increasing, and enhancing your company`s online presence to increase revenue. What this “online presence” is, varies from company to company.
                            Yet it usually revolves around <a href="on-page-optimization.html">optimizing a primary
                                website</a> or platform, and branches out from there.</p>
                        <p>It takes merely a glance to some <a href="https://www.hubspot.com/marketing-statistics">updated
                                SEO stats</a> to get a clear picture of the potential impact SEO holds for most businesses. After all, it isn`t a coincidence that over 60% of marketers have “improving SEO” and growing their organic presence as their top
                            marketing priority.
                        </p>
                        <p>The online business arena is just that relevant, with global retail eCommerce sales projected to reach $4.5 trillion within a year and a half. And the best way for a business to tap into that massive pool of potential revenue?
                            You guessed it, by having a legitimate, powerful, and effective SEO firm like ours by their side.
                        </p>
                        <p>You need a legitimate firm to avoid those so-called “SEO gurus” that make a living conning unwary businesses. At best, they eat up your budget delivering zero results. At worst, they engage in black-hat strategies that end up hurting
                            your online presence – and business – until someone like us comes around <a href="penalty-recovery.html">to fix their mistakes</a>.</p>
                        <p>You need a powerful, established firm that commands the resources necessary for your company to carve a place among competitors with a head start <a href="digital-marketing.html">in the online arena</a>.</p>
                        <p>But above all, you need an effective SEO company, able to deliver results instead of empty promises.
                        </p>
                        <p>When it comes to search optimization, it often takes more than just throwing money at the problems to get the desired outcome. Optimization is a highly experimental, tailored process that very rarely works the same way for two
                            different companies. It requires actual know-how combined with flexible strategies and skills.
                        </p>
                        <p>An effective SEO firm is one that`s clever enough, nimble enough, and adaptable enough to consistently put you in front of your audience and have them convert – Which is the “secret” behind our success.</p>
                        <p>We are not afraid to say this: We`ve cracked the code by developing a methodology and frameworks that let us consistently deliver results to our clients, adapting to the particulars of each niche.
                        </p>
                        <p>But what exactly goes into the SEO process?</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <h3>What are some common SEO services?</h3>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>At its most basic, an SEO agency needs to increase a company`s revenue by <a href="lead-management.html">bringing in more business</a> to them. This is usually accomplished by having that company`s content ranking higher on search
                            engine result pages for keywords relevant to their business.</p>
                        <p>The better a company ranks on search results pages, the more people will engage with their –
                            <a href="website-design-and-development.html">hopefully
                                optimized</a> – content and convert. Meaning, do business with them.</p>
                        <p>There are over 200 hundred factors that platforms like Google consider when deciding who goes where in search results. Listing each one goes outside our point here. However, listing a few should give you an idea of some of the
                            things that have to be mastered by a proper SEO company:</p>
                        <p>Presence of relevant, quality content.</p>
                        <p>Backlinks and site authority.</p>
                        <p>Page load speeds.</p>
                        <p>Correct schema markup.</p>
                        <p>Social signals directing traffic back to the piece.</p>
                        <p>User search intent.</p>
                        <p>Image optimization.</p>
                        <p>Mobile-readiness.</p>
                        <p>And many dozens of others that, when playing in conjunction, end up having your content ranking higher.
                        </p>
                        <p>The thing is that, for an SEO agency like OTT, that`s barely the start.</p>
                        <p>Comprehensive SEO services like ours run the gamut from <a href="on-page-optimization.html">on-page optimization</a> (those elements we discussed above) and beyond. Services like <a href="local-search-engine-optimization.html">local SEO
                                services</a>,
                            <a href="reputation-management.html">online reputation
                                management</a>,
                            <a href="website-design-and-development.html">web design and
                                development</a>, and even

                        <p>When we partner up with a company, we run a full analysis and diagnostic around all these aspects (and many others.) Then, we devise and put in motion a tailored strategy meant to power their strengths and cover/eliminate their
                            weaknesses.
                        </p>
                        <p>Having said all that, a macro-vision of our process like that can leave a few heads spinning. So, let`s step back into a more manageable context and discuss the different aspects usually included in a typical SEO services contract.
                        </p>

                        <h4>SEO Services Often Included When You Sign on With an SEO Company</h4>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>What services are included when you sign with an SEO company will vary depending on the level and scope of the company in question. From <a href="content-management.html">basic SEO optimization
                                strategies</a> to more <a href="reputation-management.html">in-depth strategies</a> that might need to be implemented on a case-by-case basis.</p>
                        <p>That said, there are a few fundamentals that form a common baseline across the industry.</p>
                        <p>Website analysis – Structure, content, and performance.</p>
                        <p>Off-page status diagnosis.</p>
                        <p>Website restructuring and code enhancement.</p>
                        <p>Onsite content optimization.</p>
                        <p>Off-page factors management.</p>
                        <p>However, if the company you are considering offers ONLY these services, you might want to keep looking. They will fall short in the long run. You certainly want all that done to your website, but you also need an SEO company who
                            is more interested in your growth than just billing you dry.</p>
                        <p>Let´s see what these services mean.</p>

                    <div class="insights-data-inner custom-scroll">

                        <p>You can waste a lot of time – yours, and your chosen SEO company’s – trying to puzzle out what they actually do. And how they go about doing it.</p>
                        <p>But being realistic, there’s little (if any) you can really do with that information.</p>
                        <p>A powerful SEO firm is not there to teach you the world of SEO any more than your doctor is there to teach you medicine. SEOs are there to study, diagnose, strategize and execute. To know what needs to be done, and do it, even
                            when you don’t. Especially when you don’t!</p>
                        <p>Don’t get us wrong, just as a skilled doctor would, an effective SEO firm will keep you well informed and on the loop of everything that’s going on. But there’s a long gulf between keeping you informed and in the loop, and teaching
                            you the whys and whens of all that’s going on.</p>
                        <p>Just like you would with a doctor, the best you can do is hire the most qualified one you can afford, and trust their skills and judgment.</p>
                        <p>Having said all that, there are a number of really important (and useful!) questions you might want to keep ready as you search and decide for an SEO service.</p>
                        <p>What does my contract/your service package include? However complex your SEO strategy gets – and trust us, it can be a whole science on its own – a reliable firm should always be able to respond to this question clearly and concisely.
                        </p>
                        <p>What does the cancellation process entail? Difficult or outright labyrinthian cancelation of service protocols is usually a clear sign of an incompetent SEO service. Concerned more with locking in clients with documents or agreements
                            than with clear results and revenue gains.</p>
                        <p>How do we stay in touch, and how often? You should understand a company’s communication structure from the get-go. That will help you set expectations and avoid disappointment/stress later down the road.</p>
                        <p>Do I have full access to my site and Analytics/AdWords accounts? This is particularly important for tech-savvy clients used to tinker with their site’s back-end. It’s not uncommon for an SEO agency to take full control of these
                            assets during the duration of the contract. You still own everything; you just won’t be able to tamper with – and potentially undermine – the SEO efforts of your chosen company while the contract lasts.
                        </p>
                        <p>Will I own my website? If the answer is no, just stand up and leave. It’s one thing to restrict access to ensure the appropriate handling, but your assets’ ownerships should always remain with you.
                        </p>
                        <p>Do you provide guarantees? If the answer is Yes, just stand up and leave. A good SEO company doesn’t! We simply understand that given the nature of the beast, guaranteeing a given result is just like “guaranteeing” a stock investment
                            will go a certain way. That said, they should have plenty of previous client documentation to support their claims, and give you a good idea of how they produce desired results.</p>
                        <p>What contracts/options are available? You should, at all times, be aware of every option on the table.
                        </p>
                        <p>How do I determine the right budget? The truth is, you don’t. But it is a FAQ so we thought we should include it. You can set your marketing goals or your available budget. But when it comes to determining the right budget to get
                            the results you are after, leave it to the pros. Cookie-cutter strategies should be avoided, as goals will vary wildly from one particular situation to another.</p>
                        <p>What are your fees and payment options? Good SEO services are very clear and upfront about the financial aspects of their services.</p>

                        <p>Why? Simply put, because <strong>we are not an ordinary SEO company</strong>. But if you have read this far, you probably noticed that already.</p>

                        <p>There’s a lot of content online – <em>Video tutorials, guides, articles, podcasts,
                                books,</em> – that you can use to learn Search Engine Optimization and SEO techniques with varying degrees of technical depth and challenge. SEO is a broad discipline that encompasses several other branches of knowledge,
                            and along the way, you’ll pick up insights on topics ranging from tech and marketing, all the way up to psychology and effective communication.</p>
                        <p>As for the best way to learn SEO, you’ll probably want to figure out what it is you are trying to accomplish first.</p>
                        <p>Do you want to learn SEO as a profession? Or maybe you just want a basic understanding to be able to communicate with your team better? Do you have a more practical/results-oriented goal in mind?
                        </p>
                        <p>Depending on the answer, some avenues might be better than others. Let’s go over some of them to figure out which one suits your needs best.</p>
                        <p><strong>Learning SEO as a Profession:</strong> Books are probably your best source of reliable, comprehensive knowledge. Reading in-depth texts on SEO gives you a deep understanding of the ins-and-outs of the industry, covering
                            the nuances that other mediums might just gloss over.</p>
                        <p>Depending on your current level of knowledge, introductory-level texts are best.
                            <strong><em>Search Engine Optimization All-in-One for Dummies</em></strong> by Bruce Clay and
                            <strong><em>The Art of SEO: Mastering Search Engine Optimization</em></strong> by Eric Enge are two great ones to get you started.</p>
                        <p>Don’t be discouraged by the “<em>For Dummies</em>” brand. This book is very approachable and an excellent starting point for everyone. The Art of SEO is written by one of the giants of the industry and serves as a great crash course
                            on the history and landscape on the subject.</p>
                        <p>Learning SEO for effective communication: One of the main challenges of hiring a digital marketing agency or an SEO consultant to take over your content’s SEO is taking a back seat and let others decide upon your business’ content.
                        </p>
                        <p>However, just by learning the basics terms and getting a sense of what each strategy is about you can become a part of the conversation productively.</p>
                        <p>Keep a journal and jot down unknown words and strategy names as they come up. Later, do a simple google search on them and pick up the basics of what they are about. Just by doing this simple task you’ll get a solid understanding
                            of what’s going on, and will be able to pitch in and steer the process much more efficiently. It’s all about using the expertise of your SEO assets to the fullest.</p>
                        <p><strong>Learning SEO Practically:</strong> Lastly, a lot of people want to learn SEO basics in a practical manner, to improve their online content as soon as possible.</p>
                        <p>It is a valid approach and one that has been made relatively easy due to the sheer number of DIY guides, How-To ‘s and explainer videos on the subject you can find online.</p>
                        <p>Granted, these sources won’t cover the more complex processes, and the more advanced techniques might be too difficult to implement by yourself. But even the most basics SEO strategies can have a powerful impact on your content’s
                            exposure, and this is entirely possible to do by following guides from reliable sources.</p>

                        <p>If you have reached this article, you probably Googled “How do I SEO my WordPress Site?” or something along those lines. We are here to give you 5 actionable tips that you can start implementing now if you have a WordPress site
                            and want to start gaining visibility using Search Engine Optimization.</p>
                        <p>Before taking any steps to optimize your site, check that your visibility settings are configured in a way that allows search engines to crawl an index your site. You can do this by going to Settings&gt; Reading&gt;Search Engine
                            Visibility, unticking the box and clicking “save changes.”</p>
                        <p>Once we are sure our site is actually being crawled, we can start implementing SEO strategies that will have your WP site moving up the search results rankings.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <h2>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Change the default permalink</h2>
                        <p>WP’s permalink is an odd code that looks somewhat like this: <em>?p=[id]</em>. This doesn’t really tell search engines anything about your site, or the page itself. There are two ways of improving this.</p>
                        <p>The first one is substituting the default link with the page or post´s name. The second one is using relevant keywords as the link.</p>
                        <p>How do you go about doing this?</p>
                        <p>You can edit the permalink by going to Settings &gt; Permalinks. You can go with several options, but “Post Name” is the standard.</p>
                        <p>If you want to use relevant keywords instead, you can edit the permalink manually right before publishing a post or page.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <h2>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Install an SEO Plugin</h2>
                        <p>There are different plugins available that will help you optimize your WP site. The most popular ones are All-in-One SEO-Pack and Yoast. They are both effective in helping you optimize your site, even if you have no knowledge of
                            SEO when you first start. You can use both to optimize each post that you publish, but Yoast has certain features such as content analysis, SEO scoring, and focus keyword that make it easier for SEO beginners. Additionally,
                            Yoast will create an XML map automatically, which brings us to our next point.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <h2>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; XML sitemap: a must have</h2>
                        <p>In a nutshell, the XML sitemap is what tells Google all it needs to know about your website and all its pages. The XML sitemap lists all the content of your site, and it makes it easier for Google to find and index it. If you want
                            to check out what your site´s map looks like, all you need to do is type your site’s URL followed by /sitemap_index.xml.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <h2>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Use rel=”canonical”</h2>
                        <p>You should enable this tag as soon as you install the SEO plugin of your choice. Using this tag for all the pages on your website will help search engines determine what the original URL of the content on your blog is, eliminating
                            duplicate content issues. &nbsp;</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <h2>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Improve your site’s loading speed</h2>
                        <p>Loading speed is one of the main factors search engines like Google take into account when ranking sites. This can be done using a caching plugin. You are probably wondering why loading speed is so important, and the reason is
                            that Google wants to provide its users with the best experience possible when they are browsing the web. In the era of instant gratification, no one wants to wait more than a few seconds for a site to load. And Google knows
                            it.

                            are.
                        </p>
                        <p>SEO specialists in different fields such as SEO managers, content writers, web developers and graphic designers are now more in demand than ever before, and salaries show how valued they are.
                        </p>
                        <p>Many also make extra income from bonuses derived from the campaigns’ performance and getting their clients the results they expected. This depends on the agreements they have with each client upon being hired.</p>

                        <p>Generating quality content is the bread and butter of any SEO strategy. To write articles that are SEO friendly, you need to apply at least a few of the most common SEO strategies like keyword research, topical relevance, proper
                            formatting, and most important of all: <strong><em>provide value to your
                                    audience</em></strong>.</p>
                        <p>The internet is built on content, and as much as we tend to put weight into the mechanical side of Search Engine Optimization, the side that considers algorithms, SERPs, and metadata, you should never forget that, at the end of
                            the day, you are producing content for human eyes with human needs and human minds.</p>
                        <p>So, the golden rule of writing SEO friendly and relevant articles (<em>even beyond the
                                technical
                                advice that follows</em>) is never to forget who your audience is and cater to provide what they seek.</p>
                        <p>Once you know the type of content you want to base your article on, there are plenty of steps or strategies you need to take care of to have an SEO friendly piece of content when it’s all said and done.</p>
                        <p>The following list is by no means exhaustive or comprehensive, but it will, however, provide you with a more than solid starting ground to start improving the kind of content you put out (
                            <em>SEO-wise</em>) seemingly overnight.

                        <h2>Tips to write SEO-friendly Articles:</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Figure out the topic:</strong> This is a vital step that most people take for granted. If you want a piece of content to be relevant, it has to be topical and in direct relation to your potential viewers’ interests.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>You don’t need to spend weeks, or even days figuring out the topic for a single article. But there are a few significant tentpole characteristics that can dramatically improve any piece of content you produce once you figure them
                            out. Understand who the article is for, why they will find it relevant, and the practical value of reading it will leave them with. Do this, and you’ll be on the right track even before you write word one.
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Do some Keyword Research:</strong> Doing KW research can help you on different fonts depending on the way you go about it. If you already know your topic, doing KW research will zero-in the best possible words you can
                                use to support the content you want to produce. Let the research inform your word choices, and it will increase the overall effectiveness of the piece.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>By the same token, if you have a rough idea of what you want your article to be about but don’t know how to tackle it, doing KW research around the topic might net you exciting and relevant ways to narrow down and help your creative
                            process.
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Format Properly:</strong> Formatting is crucial in any type of internet content, and you should be aware of the kind of formatting that fits the article you want to write. Talking about the format in a vacuum is difficult
                                at best. Much of it depends on your goals and adapting those to your audience.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>For example, don’t write overly long articles for rather simple topics. And don’t do a brief, fluff piece for things your audience wants to know in depth. Depict your ideas and information in a clear and readable manner. Use fonts
                            and words that are simple and easy to understand.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Provide Value:</strong> Last but not least, is value.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>What’s the takeaway? What’s the benefit your piece is bringing to those that engage with it? Value has everything to do with the lasting impression a viewer will take with them after they are done with your content. Provide good
                            value (which can be information, entertainment, artistic, etc.), and they’ll want to come back for more.

                    <h3>Is SEO Free?</h3>
                    <div class="insights-data-inner custom-scroll">

                        <p>SEO <em>can</em> be free, <em>if</em> you take care of it yourself. When we talk about SEO, we are discussing many strategies intended to feature online content more prominently on search engines results. While some of these approaches
                            (
                            <em>like setting up pay-per-click ad campaigns</em>) can require an investment in money, many other SEO practices can be implemented at no monetary cost if you learn how to do them yourself.
                        </p>
                        <p>Do keep in mind that any SEO practice you engage with on your own require a time investment at the very least. Which, depending on your technical know-how, might end up being quite high.
                        </p>
                        <p>Fortunately, there’s a lot of documentation online that can help you in this endeavor, and taking care of your own SEO – at least initially – will grant you a few advantages.</p>
                        <p>For one, you’ll start benefitting right from the start by improving your content until you are able to hire an agency to take it to the next level. For another, you’ll begin accumulating some knowledge on the subject, which will
                            come in handy later down the road when you have to make strategic choices and oversee the SEO task an agency recommends for your business.</p>
                        <p>As far as the strategies themselves, here are a few of the free SEO practices we believe should be at the top of your priority list:</p>
                        <p><strong>Market Research/Analysis:</strong> Thoroughly knowing and understanding your target audience is an essential building block of any SEO strategy. It stands to reason that it be one of the first things you should focus on
                            before moving onto more involved tasks. In principle, doing this type of analysis might sound daunting, but as someone with intimate knowledge of your product, you are uniquely equipped to determine the info you need.</p>
                        <p>Make a profile (<em>and keep it updated</em>) on your content’s target audience: Age, Sex, Geographic Location, Needs related to your product. And let this profile inform and improve your other SEO strategies as you move on.</p>
                        <p><strong>Keyword Research:</strong> Once you know who you are creating content for, you can move on to one of the big ones as far as SEO strategies go: Keyword Research.
                            <strong>KR</strong> is all about finding out which words people use to find the type of content or product you are offering. You can use free tools like Google’s <a href="https://adwords.google.com/ko/KeywordPlanner/Home">Keyword Planner</a>                            to this end, and use your target audience profile to further home in those perfect keywords you can use to lead them to your online content.
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Generate Content:</strong> Once you have a solid understanding of the audience you are trying to attract, and know the most popular keywords they use to find the type of content you offer, it is time to start creating quality
                            content utilizing this information. Content comes in many shapes, and it will all depend on the type of business you have.</p>
                        <p>Someone selling on Amazon might start a blog with reviews for their products, and link back to their listings. A photographer might start an online portfolio, using the Keywords he researched on the image titles or descriptions.
                        </p>
                        <p>Using these strategies cost you no money, and they are bound to have a positive impact on your online presence.</p>

                        <p>While SEO refers to Search Engine Optimization, and speaks to the different digital marketing strategies that can be put in place to improve a piece of online content prominence and exposure on the internet. SMO stands for
                            <strong>Social Media Optimization</strong>, and relates to all strategies used to achieve a better image and standing using social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.
                        </p>
                        <p>Online marketing is all about making sure people are finding your products and interacting with your brand before they do so with your competitor’s. It’s about connecting with your customers, and in this regard, there are few more
                            powerful platforms than what social media has become over the past decade.</p>
                        <p>Roughly 70% of the United States population has some form of Social Media presence, which right of the bat speaks of the potential reach using these platforms for marketing can bring to the table.
                        </p>
                        <p>By their very nature, Social Media platforms are the ideal ecology to nurture elusive and valuable things every business should be trying to achieve: Brand awareness, brand projection, positive client interaction, and reputation
                            management.
                        </p>
                        <p>With that in mind, SMO becomes the discipline of shaping out, and honing around, those precepts and core objectives. Offering several great usages for social media platforms as a form of marketing which can bring a lot of value
                            to any digital marketing campaign.</p>
                        <p><strong>Some popular tasks often used in SMO are:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Social Media Platform Assessment:</strong> Although any of the major social media platforms out there right now are bound to bring something to the table as far as marketing advantages, not all platforms are created

                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Different social media ecosystems might resonate with different types of content better. Doing a thorough assessment of their strengths, weaknesses, and how those particularities might relate to the kind of industry you are in
                            or the type of content you want to promote, can make or break your SMO strategy.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Social Media Content Management &amp; Production</strong>: At the end of the day, social media platforms are content distribution networks. Each one has a different flavor, follows different customs, and sticks to different
                                trends, but in the end, they all distribute content.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Having a dedicated person (<em>or staff team, depending on the magnitude of the SMO plan you
                                are

                            and engaging content that will resonate with the audiences is intended for.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Metrics analysis &amp; Implementation:</strong> One of the huge advantages of using these platforms as marketing tools, is the sheer number of metrics and data you can make use of.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Some platforms (<em>like Facebook</em>) excel at this better than others, but in the end, all of them have some form of metrics, trends, and user models that need to be kept an eye on. Patterns that can be used to refine further
                            and improve your strategies to make them more effective.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Interconnectivity and cross-pollination: SMO</strong> should not occur in a vacuum. Instead, creating positive feedback loops between your social media marketing efforts and your other type of digital marketing (
                                <em>SEO and SEM</em>) helps potentiate the whole scheme by feeding on one another.</li>

                        <p>The ultimate goal of SMO setups is to keep people going from different instances of your content to the others. People who find you on Facebook are directed to your online store. People who see one of your PPC ads on Google might

                        <p>Objectively, neither practice is better than the other. Both, Search Engine Optimization and Search Engine Marketing are disciplines that try to accomplish the same goal:
                            <strong><em>Improving your content’s exposure</em></strong>. However, they go about it in slightly different ways and utilizing different approaches and strategies.
                        </p>
                        <p>With that in mind, which of the two is subjectively better depends significantly on your specific goals for your campaign and content, and the resources you have available to meet them.
                        </p>
                        <p>Contingent on your particular situation, one or the other can serve your needs better. Let’s take a look at each practice individually to see where they shine and where they lack, so you are better equipped to determine which one
                            can serve you best.</p>
                        <p>We already established that both practices aim to increase your content’s exposure, but it might be useful to reiterate that SEO focuses on using techniques to organically grow your content’s prominence over time, while SEM includes
                            paid digital marketing tactics that can have a noticeable effect faster, but at the cost of monetary investment.</p>
                        <p><strong>Some of the most common SEO practices are:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Keyword research and implementation</li>
                            <li>Optimized content creation</li>
                            <li>On-page optimization (<em>design, load times, navigation, readability, etc.</em>)</li>
                            <li>HTML and Coding improvements (<em>Proper URL formatting, crawler-tagging, etc</em>.)
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Some of the most common SEM practices are:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>PPC (<em>Pay-Per-Click</em>) Ads Campaigns.</li>
                            <li>PPC Listings.</li>
                            <li>Social Media Paid Advertising.</li>
                            <li>Metrics management and optimization.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Now, both approaches have their advantages and disadvantages. And can accomplish wonders for your content when implemented in tandem. Any holistic digital marketing will most likely make use of both practices to different degrees
                            at different points of the campaign. However, the distinction between them is mostly marked by the resources necessary for their optimal use.</p>
                        <p>One of the great advantages that SEO brings to the table is its approachability and its permanence. You can hire a company to take care of your SEO needs whenever you can spare the budget for it. But even if you don’t, there are
                            plenty of SEO tasks that you can start implementing yourself in the meantime to greatly benefitting your content.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, since SEM revolves around paid advertisement systems, having an initial marketing budget to cover the setup and ongoing costs of having paid advertisement running is an entry point hurdle to overcome.</p>
                        <p>Another big difference between them is accessibility.</p>
                        <p>Some of the basic SEO practices require little knowledge for you to try and implement them to some degree of success. There’s little chance you can hurt your efforts by trying SEO techniques even by yourself.</p>
                        <p>SEM, however, is a bit more restrictive if you want to do it right. At least some knowledge of marketing and copywriting is necessary for PPC ads to be effective, as well as an understanding of the whole search engine or social
                            media marketing platform.</p>
                        <p>Another significant divergence between them is that, while SEO grows your exposure over time (and remains working even long after you have stopped proactively implementing it) SEM practices like PPC ads only work as long as you
                            can support paying for them. As such, there’s a genuine chance to hurt your marketing efforts with ineffective ads that you have to be constantly paying to keep up.</p>
                        <p>At the end of the day, which route is best for you depends much on what you want, and the resources you have to achieve it. If you are unsure, you should defer to the recommendations your chosen digital marketing company makes
                            as far as your particular situation.</p>

                        <p>It is a common topic in the industry. For one, most clients are often curious about it and ask to better understand what goes into the job. For another, people looking to get into the business always ask the question as a reference
                            for the path they should follow.</p>
                        <p>In any case, those three major disciplines fulfill a role to different degrees in almost any SEO project, and by extension, are handled to some extent by any SEO professional. That being said, there are also many complementary
                            skills and knowledge sources that also complement the few big ones.</p>
                        <p>To better understand what skills are needed for SEO, let’s divide them into those categories and take a closer look at the role they play:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Marketing and Advertisement</strong>: When it’s all said and done, optimizing content for search engines is an advertisement enterprise. No matter your particular goals for a piece of content online, if you are doing
                                SEO for it, the aim is to drive more people to find it through search engines and interact with it.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>As such, any SEO job needs to be carried out with that ultimate goal in mind. The strategies you end up going for, and the content you create, should always be informed by that ultimate goal, and the professions of marketing and
                            advertisement are the perfect source to find ways to communicate with customers effectively, and doing so in an appealing way. SEO can’t happen without those.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Technology &amp; Software:</strong> You can’t do SEO without tech. The whole discipline is based around the way in which the internet was built, and how we use it to share information today.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>In that sense, understanding how search technology works – <em>search engine algorithms,
                                keyword
                                research, digital trends</em> – is also a fundamental pillar of any SEO endeavor. Now, not every SEO professional need to also be an accomplished programmer or designer, but the more knowledge one can accumulate in those
                            areas, the more versatility and skilled the SEO expert will be to handle any SEO project.
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Creative Content Production:</strong> Understanding of marketing and tech aren’t enough. Any SEO project comes hand in hand with content. Content you want to use to tug people’s attention. Content that can effectively
                                carry a message. Content that will stand out from the competition and get you the views you are after.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>And that’s why any SEO professional needs also have some expertise in content management and production, even if he’s not directly producing it himself, the overseeing efforts go much more smoothly if they understand personally
                            everything that goes into such tasks.</p>
                        <p>As far as complementary skills that can benefit any SEO project, the list is expansive. However, some of the most valuable are:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Critical thinking.</li>
                            <li>Effective communication.</li>
                            <li>Programming/Web Development.</li>
                            <li>Problem-solving.</li>
                            <li>Management.</li>
                            <li>Investigation &amp; Research.</li>
                            <li>Decision Making.</li>
                            <li>Flexibility.</li>
                        </ul>

                    <h3>What are SEO and SEM?</h3>
                    <div class="insights-data-inner custom-scroll">
                        <p>The two terms are closely related, as both refer to practices intended to achieve the same goal:
                            <em>drive more visitors to your online content</em>. However, they go about it in slightly different ways. Search Engine Optimization (
                            <strong>SEO</strong>) is all about organically increasing your site’s ranking over time. Search Engine Marketing (<strong>SEM</strong>), on the other hand, tries to achieve this by taking advantage of paid digital marketing
                            models such as Pay-Per-Click ads.</p>
                        <p>It is good to point out that sometimes the term <strong>SEM</strong> is used as an umbrella term to encompass both approaches. Meaning that people talking about <strong>SEM</strong> might be referring to the implementation of organic
                            SEO techniques, combined with paid digital marketing.</p>
                        <p>It is an important distinction to make since each practice comes with its own set of advantages and challenges. And depending on your goals and budget, one might fit your needs better than the other. So, let’s go over some of these
                            differences to help you better gauge which approach might suit your particular situation best.
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Advantages of an SEO focused approach (Organic growth):</strong></p>
                        <p><strong>Costs:</strong> Most SEO strategies can be implemented without the need for direct investment, especially if you take care of them yourself, which suits your need for advertisement on a tight budget.</p>
                        <p><strong>Endurance:</strong> Many of the systems and changes you put in place while working on your content’s search engine optimization will remain in place and viable for a long time. This means that even if you hire an agency
                            to take care of it for you, you’ll keep benefitting long after you have ended their services.
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Branding:</strong> Having well-placed pages on organic results drives more credibility and user awareness to your content than advertised links. While it takes longer to get there, this might provide increased CTR and conversions
                            as you begin to be placed as an authority on the subject.</p>
                        <p><strong>Challenges of an SEO focused approach (Organic growth):</strong></p>
                        <p><strong>Windup:</strong> SEO strategies usually take longer to take hold and start showing results, which might be an issue when you are on a schedule or trying to bring awareness to your content in the least amount of time possible.
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Time investment:</strong> Effective SEO can’t be accomplished overnight, and there are usually many involved tasks that require constant gauging, fine-tuning, and upkeep. This means that proper SEO is very involved and
                            time-consuming.
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Advantages of an SEM focused approach (Paid Advertisement):</strong></p>
                        <p><strong>Instant Positioning:</strong> One of the critical benefits of PPC ads is positioning. In Google, ads results appear first even before the top organic result, which gives your content a significant advantage when it comes
                            to catching potential viewer’s attention.</p>
                        <p><strong>High targetability:</strong> On platforms like Instagram or Facebook you are offered an ample array of variables to make sure your ads are reaching precisely the people whose attention you are trying to attract. Categories
                            like age, sex, and interest can help make sure your message reaches your audience.</p>
                        <p><strong>Customization:</strong> While you have little control over how your content is displayed on organic search results and which pieces of content will get featured, PPC ads are highly customizable. You are in full control
                            of what will be presented and how. This means that you can make use of powerful copywriting and marketing strategies to capture a viewer’s attention in a reliable, consistent manner.
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Challenges of an SEM focused approach (Paid Advertisement):</strong></p>
                        <p><strong>Costs:</strong> While an adequately configurated PPC campaign doesn’t have to be expensive (<em>and can offer good ROI numbers</em>) the fact that you need to pay every time someone interacts with the ad might present a
                            challenge. Particularly in the beginning when you are fine-tuning the ad into efficiency.
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Competition:</strong> Even after you have attained the perfect ad that gives you the results you want, competitors can come around and copy it, or simply outbid you and make it less effective. Something that is nearly impossible
                            to do with organic growth strategies.</p>
                        <p>As you can see, both approaches can be very powerful, and their effectivity relies on the goals you are pursuing, and the resources you have to achieve them.</p>

                <div class="insights-data" data-info="What does an SEO Agency do?">
                    <h3>What does an SEO Agency do?</h3>
                    <div class="insights-data-inner custom-scroll">

                        <p>Good SEO agencies are staffed with experienced marketers, designers, content writers and SEO specialists who are also assertive enough to be part of the decision-making process.</p>
                        <p>This first thing an SEO agency must do is to understand what conversion means to the client. Some just want to increase their sales in Ebay or Amazon. Others want their restaurant to be among the top picks when people perform a
                            local search on Google. Still others just want to outperform Wikipedia in searches related to certain topics for academic or promotional purposes.</p>
                        <p>Still, even when the client knows what their organization should be pursuing, it is common to see them overextending their reach and trying to employ every marketing channel they know of and then some. This often causes an incontrollable
                            bleeding of resources, and many don´t even know where their money is going until it is too late.
                        </p>
                        <p>A true SEO agency will always try to understand the client´s goals. Then they will gather information about their audience and the promotion channels they are using. The next step is to identify the most efficient channels based
                            on the kind of interaction they want their visitors to have with their product and what channels are the most effective with that specific audience.</p>
                        <p>Once the right channels have been identified, your SEO agency will set your campaign goals.
                        </p>
                        <p>One of the biggest mistakes many marketers make is to only set long term goals. This creates a colossal problem in the long run as these goals are difficult to modify without making the client feel the campaign was a whole waste
                            of their time and money. It also makes the decision-making process more difficult. Search engines have imposed a faster-than-light culture in the marketing industry. This makes it difficult to wait for feedback from clients
                            to make the myriads of changes or small tweaks needed to keep a website in good standings with search engines.
                        </p>
                        <p>A good SEO agency will only set short term goals that can be readily measured and can have observable impact on the variables the client needs to improve. This allows more flexibility when designing strategies, and gives more leeway
                            to those in charge of designing the campaign or creating the content as they do not have to wait until the campaign is finished to see whether their efforts had the intended impact or not.
                        </p>
                        <p>This articulated approach should always be accompanied by regular progress reports to show the client how their money is being used and that their investment is working for them.</p>
                        <p>But this constant process of tweaking and refinement should also be coordinated so everyone knows what the current goals are, what strategies other departments are implementing and how their own tasks will impact the work of others
                            and the overall results.</p>
                        <p>Here is where the cohesive aspects of a well-coordinated SEO agency come into play. We have seen many teams with awesome players in their rooster, and we have also been witness to their equally spectacular demise. Why is that?
                            Mostly because SEO is a team sport. It does not matter if you have all the best players under the same roof if everyone is just doing his thing and clocking out at five o´clock. There must be a careful planning process so everyone
                            knows what their team mates need. For example, you can have the best graphic designers but still deliver a mediocre website if the content does not match what your writers are trying to convey with it. And this problem gets
                            worse if there is no general marketing strategy and specific goals set for each department.
                        </p>

                    <h3>What is an SEO specialist?</h3>
                    <div class="insights-data-inner custom-scroll">

                        <p>SEO specialist is a term we can use for both, a person or company, whose expertise is focused on Search Engine Optimization and subjects related to it.</p>
                        <p>Initially, the term Search Engine Optimization (<em>SEO</em>) was used exclusively to refer to those strategies used to positively influence the visibility of content (<em>websites,
                                profiles,
                                videos, etc</em>.) on the results pages from sites like Google, Bing, and Yahoo. Nowadays, it has become more of a blanket term, adopted by the industry to describe not only Search Engine Optimization proper but many other
                            tangential online marketing approaches that can be implemented toward the same goal.</p>
                        <p>Thus, an SEO specialist is someone who has acquired – <em>through study and experience</em> – a number of skills that allows them to effectively devise, implement, and supervise SEO and digital marketing solutions. Ensuring their
                            client’s online content is displayed more prominently on search engines result pages.</p>
                        <p>From a technical standpoint, there are a few things considered vital for an SEO specialist to do their job right.</p>
                        <p>It goes without saying that a close understanding of the inner workings of search engines and search algorithms is an essential building block for any SEO specialist. Beyond that, at least some knowledge of coding and programming
                            becomes a huge plus that increases their effectiveness.</p>
                        <p>Even if they aren’t programmers or designers per se, understanding how pages are put together, and how their different component’s attributes directly affect the overall site’s visibility, is one of those nuances that SEO specialists
                            are uniquely equipped to take advantage of.</p>
                        <p>Now, beyond technical knowledge, there are also a number of skills and insights that elevate someone who merely knows about SEO, to the ranks of an SEO specialist. These falls mostly on the human side of things.</p>
                        <p>Skills like having good problem-solving skills, organization, being adept at analysis, and being able to conduct adaptable decision-making processes are also integral components of SEO specialists.
                        </p>
                        <p>You need to keep in mind that doing Search Engine Optimization is very much a technical art, which combines the precise know-how of computer technology, with an intimate understanding of how people interact with it. For those reasons,
                            most SEO specialists tend to be equal parts engineers and humanists in their way of thinking.
                        </p>
                        <p>Lastly, an effective SEO specialist needs also to be an effective marketer.</p>
                        <p>When it is all said and done, Search Engine Optimization is all about effectively connecting content with people. Be it creators and viewers, nonprofits with backers, or companies with potential customers. Which means that a solid
                            grasp of marketing techniques (<em>and keeping up with the latest social trends</em>) also fall under the purview of a competent SEO specialist.</p>
                        <p>Being a knowledgeable nexus of these different disciplines is necessary to be able to implement the technical strategies SEO specialist develop on paper, in a way that is both efficient and effective in the real world.</p>
                        <p>The end goal of all SEO specialists is to get results for their clients, which is a concept that varies significantly on an individual case by case basis.</p>

                    <h3>What is SEO Marketing</h3>
                    <div class="insights-data-inner custom-scroll">
                        <p>SEO marketing is the use of specialized tools to analyze a website from various perspectives and find correlations between its elements and factors that help increase visibility, traffic, conversions, brand awareness or whatever
                            it is that the client wants to achieve with his or her website.</p>
                        <p>Notice that clients might have completely different things in mind when deciding it is time to create a website. An online store will not merely need increased traffic. Visits for them are of no use if they don´t convert into sales.
                            Contrastingly, an organization focused on raising awareness on certain social issues will want people to share their content and maybe turn visitors into activists without necessarily having to make a single sale.</p>
                        <p>A good online marketing agency will always focus on measurable data and specific processes that have a direct impact on concrete aspects that need improvement. When a strategy is being built, you need to know where all your resources
                            are going, and have an idea of the time it will take for results to show.</p>
                        <p>This is why it is so important to avoid making business with anyone who speaks in vague terms about what they can do for you. Ambiguity means that they will always put the blame on something out of their control, even you, when
                            they start missing goalposts.</p>
                        <p>Expert SEO marketers will always show you relevant data and specific actions that clearly impact the variables that affect you.</p>
                        <p>But SEO marketing does not stop there. Most departments within an SEO Agency depend on the plan devised by marketing strategists. Marketing specialists are also in charge of the approach that the design, content, development and
                            SEO departments will take with each client.</p>
                        <p>After they study a client´s competitors, new trends in design and content creation, the latest tools and apps available, and even current political and social events, they determine the course of action a company should take. They´re
                            the ones who decide what a new website should look like, what tone should the content have, what topics should be avoided, and how the general user experience should be. They also recommend courses of action like organizing
                            special events, discovering sponsoring opportunities, setting up sweepstakes campaigns, sending out press releases, and everything that could have an impact on how the public perceives their client.
                        </p>
                        <p>Of course, it all must be measured and pondered to calculate risks and opportunities and making sure every action affects the brand positively. Constant communication with the client is key. All actions, results and data must be
                            gathered in comprehensive reports and delivered periodically. It not only serves as a tool for directing marketing efforts, but it also shows the client where his or her dollars are being spent and if that spending is justified.

                        <p>This means that SEO marketing is much more than just selling. It is both a science and an art. We use objective data to design strategies aimed to meet your organization´s goals, and then measure the results in real time so you
                            always know how your investment impacts your overall performance. But it is also an art that transforms your product or brand in the eyes of your audience to create trust and foster customer loyalty.

                    <h3>Why SEO Services</h3>
                    <div class="insights-data-inner custom-scroll">
                        <p>SEO services allow your organization to objectively find measurable actions that make it easier for your website to convert. Often, the number of actions is vast enough to require a highly specialized group of people to execute
                            them effectively. These can include lead generation, running targeted advertisements, providing measurement and sales tools, building sales channels to reach new customers, and the creation of content and design specifically
                            directed at your target audience.</p>
                        <p>In spite of a popularity surge in recent years, many people are still reluctant to hire SEO services. The most common reasons they blurt out when asked are associated with the perceived size of their own operations. There is a
                            common misconception that only big companies need or can afford to invest on SEO services. But this myth is easily debunked by just pointing out some hard-data-based facts.</p>
                        <p>We like to say that SEO is the great market equalizer. You might not have the marketing resources of a multi-billion-dollar corporation, but you can certainly create relevant content and expertly crafted strategies that will put
                            you on top of local searches without having to go bankrupt trying to outbid your competitors. That´s why size does not matter in the end, as long as you understand what your audience wants and how to rub Google the right way.</p>
                        <p>Most people do not realize this, but SEO is not a pay-to-win industry. SEO services are a combination of highly specialized web design tools with expert marketing coaching.</p>
                        <p>The internet was certainly a blessing for small businesses. It opened channels that allowed them to reach customers they would have never dreamed of. However, like any other tool ever invented, you have to know how to use it if
                            you want to benefit from it.</p>
                        <p>Most business owners have already taken the first step in the right direction: they have created a website that showcases their products and provides a channel for customers to reach them. But this is not enough. Not by a long
                            shot.
                        </p>
                        <p>Before a website starts generating even a single visit, it must be found. This means that it should comply with certain objective and subjective parameters. Some of these parameters are explicitly laid out by search engines, while
                            others fall in the realm of human behavior studies.</p>
                        <p>For example, a website must be properly coded so Google can correctly index it. It must also be organized in such a way Google robots crawl it efficiently. Proper layout, rich content, and smooth loads are among the aspects that
                            search engines assess in order to deem a page worth their users´ time.</p>
                        <p>But even if your page is properly indexed, there is still a lot to do if you want people to know your website even exists. It is a known fact that 75% of users never go past the first page of searches. So if your page is not among
                            the top 10 results for any given search, you might as well not have one.</p>
                        <p>This is why SEO services go way beyond just creating a nice looking and efficient website. SEO experts will also tell you how to attract customers or how to create a campaign that will eventually position your page in that coveted
                            first page. And here is where you can actually beat big household names.</p>

                        <p>You can start improving your website’s SEO by taking care of a handful of critical tasks grouped in three areas that search engine algorithms pay a lot of attention to, but most people tend to neglect to varying degrees: Improvements
                            to your site’s coding and formatting, improvements to your site’s content, and improvements in your data analysis and planning.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <h2>Improvements to your Site’s Coding and Formatting:</h2>
                        <p>This is one of the most straightforward areas to fix, but since it requires at least some understanding of the technical side of things, most people tend to have websites with subpar coding and formatting, which ends up playing
                            against them with search engine algorithms.</p>
                        <p>This area is all about making sure that the nuts and bolts of your pages are all tight, and in a way that will help algorithms understand what your content is about, and that your site is healthy and current.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <h2>Checklist:</h2>

                        <p>You can find in-depth guides on how to take care of each of those tasks for your site. Some require a bit more of technical know-how than others, but every single one has a considerable weight when it comes to staying on algorithms’
                            good graces.</p>

                        <p>Content is paramount.</p>
                        <p>It doesn’t matter how much optimization you make, at the end of the day people visit sites for their content, and yours needs to live up to their expectations.</p>
                        <p>Quality content is the most reliable way to increase your website’s prominence in SERPs over time organically, and the best way to ensure that once someone sees your site, they’ll want to come back.

                        <p>When most people set out to improve their sites, they neglect to take a deep, honest, look at their initial metrics (<em>sites visits, content response, social media engagement,
                                etc.</em>) What’s even worse, they fail to keep a close track of how their changes affect (<em>both, positively or negatively</em>) their website’s overall performance.</p>
                        <p>Keeping an eye on your site’s metrics, and implementing changes based on what those numbers suggest is the only reliable way to grow your website’s popularity consistently.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <h2>Checklist:</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Keep track on page-speed load times and improve when possible.</li>
                            <li>Use Google webmaster tools and analytics</li>
                            <li>Keep close track (journal, file) of relevant metrics: which days you get your most views, which topics see more engagement, etc. And let those number informs the tasks and content you should implement next.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>Do keep in mind that SEO is all about growing your site’s prominence and exposure over time, not overnight. Give time for these improvements to take hold and be patient, once you have fixed everything that was broken on your site,
                            and begin putting out content and campaigns to attract new views, your site’s prominence and popularity will start increasing organically.</p>

                        <p>In three words: Search Engine Optimization.</p>
                        <p>Search Engine Optimization or SEO is a set of strategies designed to get traffic from free, organic search results to a website when an internet user carries out an online search for a given keyword or keyword phrases.</p>
                        <p>SEO helps websites appear in the first pages of search results. Search engines use algorithms which determine what pages “deserve” the first spots. These algorithms are constantly being updated; however, for those who truly understand
                            how SEO works and have been implementing the right strategies from the get-go, are barely affected by changes in the algorithm.</p>
                        <p>Optimize your site by carefully choosing the keywords that best describe what you write about, the products you sell or the services you offer. Then add these keywords to each page of your site by using meta tags and meta descriptions.
                            You can also optimize the images you use by strategically including relevant keywords in the Alt and Title texts.</p>
                        <p>Once your site is optimized and ready for the world to see, you need to take certain steps.
                        </p>
                        <p>Make sure to generate your site’s XML sitemap. This is the easiest way to tell Google exactly what your site is about and help correctly index it so that when people search for your keywords, it will show up among the results.
                            Make sure your meta tags and meta descriptions accurately convey what your site’s intent is.
                        </p>
                        <p>Add your website´s URL to the Google Search Console. This is a free service that helps you monitor your website’s performance on Google Search results. This is not an absolute must, but after you register your site on it, you can
                            “ask” Google to crawl your site’s map. This makes sure Google can access your</p>
                        <p>It can also help you learn how the search engine views your site so that you can optimize it accordingly. Additionally, you can submit new content for it to be crawled by google bots, remove content you no longer want to be indexed
                            for, and catch and solve any malware or spam issues that may affect your site.</p>
                        <p>If you own a local business, use the Google My Business. This is a free listing, and the only requirement is that you either have a physical address or that you visit your clients to provide your services.</p>
                        <p>GMB lets you manage how your business’s information appears on the search engine, including Google Maps. It also allows you to interact with your current and potential customers. They can leave reviews, which also helps your site´s
                            rankings. Additionally, you can check how people found your website and where they come from.
                        </p>
                        <p>Use your social media and link it to your site. Besides using social media for marketing purposes, you should share your site´s content (blog posts, articles, news updates, etc.) on Facebook, Google+, Instagram, and Twitter. This
                            will create external links to your site and make it a stronger candidate for page one via link building.

                        <p>If you are looking to improve your visitors’ user experience, there are three main factors that you need to take into consideration: your website´s design, its content, and its performance. These three aspects play an essential
                            role in providing any visitor with a good -or a bad- user experience, prompting them to continue browsing or to move on to the next search result.</p>

                        <p>Nowadays, 60% of users access websites via a mobile device. Making sure they can easily read and browse your website’s content from any device, be it a cell phone, a tablet, a laptop or a pc is crucial. In fact, experts now advice

                        <p>Loading speed has been named one of the critical factors in Search Engine Optimization or SEO. Why? Because technology has gotten people used to instant gratification, and search engines know it. Their main objective is to bring
                            their users the best experience, so they have made loading speed one of the top five features when ranking a site. Slow loading speed has been correlated with high bounce rates. If your site’s loading speed is not up to par,
                            you need to fix this ASAP.</p>

                        <p>Poor-performance servers can increase your site’s downtime which affects not only sales and views, but it also lowers your ranking on search results pages. You should host your website on providers that guarantee 99.99% uptime
                            and stay away from those who have reported annual uptime score below 99%. On top of that, you need to ensure that you use a trusted and secure hosting service.</p>

                        <p>Your navigation system should allow visitors to easily find the information they are looking for. To do this, improve your site´s user interface by implementing the principles of UX design. Navigation should be intuitive, i.e.,

                        <p>Your value proposition is what tells visitors what you do and why you do it. It should be in your headline and about page. This will inform your potential clients what they get out of hiring your services or buying your product.</p>

                        <p>WP’s permalink is an odd code that looks somewhat like this: <em>?p=[id]</em>. This doesn’t really tell search engines anything about your site, or the page itself. There are two ways of improving this.</p>

                            SEO when you first start. You can use both to optimize each post that you publish, but Yoast has certain features such as content analysis, SEO scoring, and focus keyword that make it easier for SEO beginners. Additionally,
                            Yoast will create an XML map automatically, which brings us to our next point.</p>

                        <h2>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; XML sitemap: a must have</h2>
                        <p>In a nutshell, the XML sitemap is what tells Google all it needs to know about your website and all its pages. The XML sitemap lists all the content of your site, and it makes it easier for Google to find and index it. If you want
                            to check out what your site´s map looks like, all you need to do is type your site’s URL followed by /sitemap_index.xml.&nbsp;</p>

                        <h2>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Use rel=”canonical”</h2>
                        <p>You should enable this tag as soon as you install the SEO plugin of your choice. Using this tag for all the pages on your website will help search engines determine what the original URL of the content on your blog is, eliminating
                            duplicate content issues.&nbsp;</p>

                        <p>Loading speed is one of the main factors search engines like Google take into account when ranking sites. This can be done using a caching plugin. You are probably wondering why loading speed is so important, and the reason is
                            that Google wants to provide its users with the best experience possible when they are browsing the web. In the era of instant gratification, no one wants to wait more than a few seconds for a site to load. And Google knows
                            it.

                        <h2>Why should you hire a PPC specialist?</h2>
                        <p>If you want to maximize the results of your PPC campaign, it is best to hire someone who knows what they are doing. After all, if the wrong people are clicking on your ads, every one of those clicks is money down the drain.

                    <div class="insights-data-inner custom-scroll">

                        <p>SEO friendly means that a website is set up in a way -from its code to its design, text, and images- that it makes easier for search engine crawlers to index the content, determine what the site is about, and show it in search
                            results pages.
                        </p>
                        <p>Being SEO friendly can help a website appear in the first pages of search results and with more than 2 billion websites, and more than 5 billion daily searches, you want your site to rank as high as possible.</p>
                        <p>But what exactly makes a site SEO friendly?</p>
                        <p>Your website’s title pages are unique, and you should tell Google by using title tags. Titles should be concise but descriptive. Use meta tags to describe what each page is about accurately; meta tags should include the most relevant
                            keywords so that you let search engine crawlers know precisely what your site is about. Use an effective meta description or description meta tag. Meta information is what Google displays when your site appears as a search
                            result. It should include relevant keywords and be brief yet persuasive to entice users to click on it. Again, each page should have a unique description.</p>
                        <p>Use easy to understand URLs. This helps you keep your content organized while allowing search engines to categorize each page on your site accurately. Ideally, you should use the words that best describe what the page is about.</p>
                        <p>Make your site easily browsable. This helps visitors quickly find what they are looking for. To accomplish this, create an intuitive hierarchy and use text for navigation. Include an HTML sitemap for users to turn to and an XML
                            sitemap so search engines can find the pages on your site.</p>
                        <p>Publish relevant, compelling content on your site. This alone will go a long way in the eyes of search engines. What’s more, users know and like to share good content, and this will also bring organic traffic to your website. The
                            first rule about SEO is that you should always put users first. They are the ones who will ultimately read and share your site or recommend your products or services. Even Google itself is in the business of making users happy,
                            so that should be your main</p>
                        <p>Use appropriate anchor text. Anchor text is the text you use to link to other pages. It should tell the user and the search engine what the page you are linking to is about.</p>
                        <p>Optimize your site’s images. You can provide information about the image using the “alt” text attribute. Doing this lets you provide information about the image if it cannot be displayed for any reason. The images’ file names should
                            also be descriptive of their content.</p>
                        <p>Use heading tags to organize your content for both the user and the crawlers. These are used to give content a visual structure that allows users to know what the most important information is. There are six heading tags from h1
                            to h6, which denote the degree of importance of any given text. Avoid using heading tags excessively or using them only for styling text. Text within a heading tag must be meaningful to the reader and to search engines.</p>
                        <p>The ultimate goal of making a website SEO friendly should be to present users with the best content possible in the best way possible. Great user experience is any search engines’ number one priority when deciding what rank a website
                            will be granted.</p>

                    <h3>What is an article in SEO?</h3>
                    <div class="insights-data-inner custom-scroll">

                        <p>In SEO or Search Engine Optimization, an article is a piece of written content aimed to improve a website’s ranking, i.e., to increase its visibility on search engines. Writing SEO articles is different from other types of written
                            content in that they are done with a concrete goal in mind. To accomplish that goal, certain guidelines need to be followed.</p>
                        <p>Writing an SEO article is not only about having excellent writing skills. Yes, good writing skills will allow you to make the piece interesting and easy to read; but it is necessary to know which are the SEO guidelines you need
                            to stick to and how to smoothly include them to ensure the article helps your site gain traction in reaching the first page of search results.</p>
                        <p>Some of the strategies that will allow your SEO article to help boost your site’s ranking are:
                        </p>
                        <p>The tactical placement of keywords and keyword phrases. These need to be consciously chosen after thorough keyword research and analysis. Ideally, this analysis should be done before starting the writing process, and there are
                            many different tools available to carry out keyword research. Keywords should be included in the title, sprinkled throughout the article, and included in subheadings. This hints crawlers about what it is you are writing about.
                        </p>
                        <p>Including internal and external links. Internal links are those who lead the reader to another page on your site. External links are those that lead to another website. The latter should direct users to reliable sources. Why? Because
                            that tells users -and google- that you are an authority in your field. When you link to other sites, you should set the link to open in a different window or a separate tab, so that the user is not removed from your website.
                            Both internal and external linking strengthen your content but also help web crawlers learn what your content is about.</p>
                        <p>Create original content. Search Engines can easily spot duplicate content and penalize your website for it by pushing it down the search results. Everything you publish should be unique, but also valuable and relevant to your visitors.
                            As Google puts it, users should always come first. You ranking in the first pages of search results, should be a by-product -a reflection- of what you are offering your customers.</p>
                        <p>It should be shareable. This can be done via backlinks on other websites, social media, or newsletters. Sharing your content has different advantages such as bringing traffic from various sources such as Facebook or Twitter and
                            creating backlinks every time a person shares your article. Backlinks are one of the most important aspects of SEO. The more external links that lead to your site, the better it will rank. This is because Google identifies
                            backlinking as proof that your content is valuable and authoritative.</p>
                        <p>Images are another important aspect of SEO articles. Your article should include them, and they should also be optimized for search engines, but since Search Engines can’t “read” them yet, you need to make sure your alt text and
                            title text are configured in a way that helps crawlers better understand your content.</p>

                        <p>An SEO or Search Engine Optimization strategist is a digital marketing professional specialized in developing and analyzing Search Engine Marketing (SEM) campaigns.</p>
                        <p>An SEO strategist uses tools such as Google Analytics to monitor and learn how a website is performing and where traffic is coming from to develop a plan to increase said website´s ranking in search engine results pages.</p>
                        <p>An SEO strategist works in close collaboration with content creators, web developers, graphic designers, and other marketing experts to create and execute a strategy that will bring more organic traffic to their clients’ sites.
                        </p>
                        <p>What are the responsibilities of an SEO strategist?</p>
                        <p>Carry out online research about consumer trends relevant to their clients.</p>
                        <p>Collect and analyze data using monitoring software. Some of these data include traffic sources, bounce rate, and others.</p>
                        <p>Learn and understand consumers’ preferences and buying habits, and identify potential markets.

                        <p>Keep up to date with changes in SEO practices and guidelines, search engine updates, and social media and internet marketing industry trends and development.</p>
                        <p>Assist in the inception of marketing content such as blog posts, case studies, video briefs, and more.
                        </p>
                        <p>Develop and implement link building campaigns.</p>
                        <p>Plan, manage, execute, and monitor content strategies via social networks.</p>
                        <p>Monitor and evaluate search results and website performance throughout the main search engines.
                        </p>

                        <p>To be able to develop an effective strategy, they need to perform keyword research, keeping the clients’ goals in mind to both optimize existing content and discover potential opportunities to reach their target audience.</p>
                        <p>Because SEO is something that needs to be done from the foundations of a site to the everyday content, an SEO strategist needs to have at least basic knowledge about the different aspects of a website, from code optimization to
                            content creation, to web design. This way, the collaboration with other specialists is easier.
                        </p>
                        <p>What skills should an SEO strategist possess?</p>
                        <p>Creative and strategic thinking.</p>
                        <p>The ability to identify and solve problems quickly.</p>
                        <p>Thorough and concise communication skills at different levels -with clients, and other SEO professionals as well as other project managers.</p>
                        <p>The ability to multitask without losing attention to details.</p>
                        <p>Efficient time management skills.</p>
                        <p>An analytical and organizational brain.</p>
                        <p>Search Engine Optimization is not a one-and-done project, is a constant effort to bring the maximum traffic flow to a client’s website; and considering that digital marketing has firmly planted its roots in the advertising world,
                            hiring an SEO strategist to rank higher on search results has never been more necessary.</p>
                        <p>A knowledgeable SEO strategist will perform a site audit before making any decisions or developing a marketing plan. Once this is done, they can identify the weaknesses and strengths of a site and strategize and act accordingly.

                    <h3>What Is SEO Writing?</h3>
                    <div class="insights-data-inner custom-scroll">

                        <p>SEO stands for Search Engine Optimization and, simply put, SEO writing is creating content that will help you optimize your content for Search Engines.</p>
                        <p>And what is Search Engine Optimization? It Is a set of strategies that help websites rank better in search engine results pages.</p>
                        <p>However, the first rule of SEO is that users come first. Yes, it is called Search Engine Optimization, but the primary objective of search engines is to provide their users with the best content available for their search terms,
                            so your ultimate goal is to offer valuable, engaging content to those looking for information over the internet.</p>
                        <p>That being said, what does SEO writing entail?</p>
                        <p>SEO writing consists of following certain guidelines and strategies to help a website’s content naturally gain visibility. In order to do this, here is what you need to know.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <h2>Find the Right Keywords</h2>
                        <p>And use them strategically throughout the text. Keywords are those terms that users type on Google or other search engine’s search bar when they are trying to find information about something. Incorporating relevant keywords in
                            your site’s content will help search engines determine what it is that you offer, and match search results with your content. However, this needs to be done in a very specific way:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>They should be included in the meta tags for each page of your site.</li>
                            <li>They should be included in headings and subheadings whenever possible.</li>
                            <li>They should be used sparingly in the paragraphs of your pages.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Bear in mind that overusing keywords can make web crawlers flag you as spam and send you all the way to the bottom of the list of search results or not show your site at all.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <h2>Use Meta Information Wisely</h2>
                        <p>By meta information we mean title tags and meta descriptions. These help search engines understand what the content on a page is about. This is also the information that appears in the search results pages when your page shows
                            up as a potential hit. Which means it is what makes a user click or skip your page when presented by the search engine. That is why writing enticing meta tags can make more people click through to your site from the list of
                            search results.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <h2>Create Unique Content that Solves a Problem or Answers a Question</h2>
                        <p>And do it in a way that makes readers want to stay on your site. How many times have you clicked on a search result only to find out that the content was not what you were looking for, or worse, that it was nothing related to your
                            search? This happens because people want to get traffic at any cost and use less than ethical SEO techniques. This is what gives SEO a bad rep.</p>
                        <p>To provide your potential clients or visitors with the content they need, you must understand who your target market is. If you know them accurately, you should be able to provide the information they need or want to read in a
                            way that is appealing, entertaining, and useful.</p>
                        <p>And this should be done targeting those keywords we spoke about above.</p>
                        <p>Your content should be so useful and easy to read, that it makes people want to share it with the world.
                        </p>

                <div class="insights-data" data-info="Why we do SEO?">
                    <h3>Why we do SEO?</h3>
                    <div class="insights-data-inner custom-scroll">

                        <p>If you distilled the answer to why we do SEO all the way down to a single purpose, it’d probably
                            <strong><em>be to connect</em></strong>. We do SEO because we want to connect our content with that vast pool of information that is the internet. We do it because we want that content to connect effectively with search engine
                            algorithms, reliably and productively. <strong>We do SEO because we want our content to
                                connect
                                with as many interested people as possible</strong>.</p>
                        <p>So, let’s look at the answer from those three perspectives to illustrate the purpose of SEO better.
                        </p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <h2>To connect with the internet:</h2>
                        <p>The internet, in and of itself, is a vast network of interconnected content, and search engines serve a crucial function that has helped shaped the way it has evolved over the years.
                        </p>
                        <p>If you wish to find something – <em>anything</em> – on the internet that you have no previous connection with, you need to use search engines. Most importantly, if you wish for people who might be interested in your content to
                            find it without you directly leading them to it, you need to make sure search engines know about your content.
                        </p>
                        <p>Otherwise, that fantastic video you made and uploaded to an unregistered website or that portfolio you uploaded to an online gallery no one knows about, will just sit on a server forever with no views and no user interaction and
                            might as well have been left in your hard drive.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <h2>To connect with Search Engine Algorithms:</h2>
                        <p>As I said, Search Engines are integral to the way we use the internet today, and their algorithms are the only reliable way machines have to make sense and sort out the massive amounts of data uploaded to the internet every single
                            minute.
                        </p>
                        <p>A computer program (<em>an algorithm</em>) is still unable to understand content in the way we humans do. So, as a workaround, we’ve designed the inner workings of search engines to identify key characteristics and markers to help
                            them sort out said content in a manner that makes sense for human users.</p>
                        <p>This idea is the principle behind SEO. That of using techniques designed to take advantage of those key characteristics by making sure they are present in the content you put out so that algorithms can reliably find it, sort it,
                            and display it to those people that might be interested in it.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <h2>To connect with People:</h2>
                        <p>When it’s all said and done, you didn’t write that beautiful poem for Google’s algorithm to sort out and placed in a data index. Your company did not upload a full online catalog of products just to have Bing crawl spiders all
                            over it. And you did not write that clever, hashtagged tweet to get a ping from Yahoo’s search engine.
                        </p>
                        <p>You did it all to connect with people.</p>
                        <p>You want those who might appreciate your poetry to read and maybe comment on it. Your company is trying to make it easier for people to buy from them. You tweeted to get others into a conversation you might enjoy.</p>
                        <p>SEO is about connecting your content with people, and the techniques and strategies that go into it always take that into account.</p>

                    <h3>What is SEO in Content Writing?</h3>
                    <div class="insights-data-inner custom-scroll">

                        <p>Content writing is one of the essential foundations of Search Engine Optimization. Just as Bill Gate’s immortalized in his famous essay “<em>Content Is King</em>,” it is content what drives the internet today. This means that both
                            notions are best understood via their interaction and dynamic: Content is what you produce to provide value to your audience. SEO are the techniques you use to make that content stand out.
                        </p>
                        <p>More specifically, <strong>content writing</strong> – <em>when viewed under the lens of
                                <strong>SEO</strong></em> – refers to any piece of writing that has been optimized to be easily found and prominently showcased by search engine algorithms.
                        </p>
                        <p>In any type of content (<em>a website, blog post, or even multimedia</em>,) you want on optimize for better internet exposure, and writing always plays a vital role. Even videos and images usually reach with titles, descriptions,
                            and hidden keywords intended to tell search algorithms what they are, and suggest their value and relevance for people doing searches.</p>
                        <p>And notice that the word <strong><em>value</em></strong> keeps popping up. Yes, optimization is made for machines and algorithms, but content is for people. SEO in content writing always needs to consider <strong>both</strong>.</p>
                        <p>Providing value to viewers is paramount, but doing so in a way that also informs search engines is essential.</p>
                        <p>With that in mind, there are a few unspoken rules when it comes to SEO in content writing, and these usually lead the actions of any SEO content writer worth their salt.</p>
                        <p><strong>Write for people first:</strong> This is the cardinal rule as far as content writing. There was a time, when the internet was younger, where black-hat SEO practices had keywords being plastered all over sites with text
                            that were little more than blocks of spam. Since then, search algorithms have learned and now punish that toxic behavior.</p>
                        <p><strong>Use Keyword-Rich Phrases:</strong> Keyword research is crucial to any SEO strategy, and content writing is a big reason why. Using relevant keywords during the writing of a value-providing piece of content is the recipe
                            for organic growth and exposure to have your site scaling that SERPs ladder.</p>
                        <p><strong>Effective Content writing is not limited to text:</strong> More on the technical side of SEO, most people might think that content writing only plays a role in text-form content. As mentioned before, multimedia content
                            has text and hidden values that also require appropriate writing, and the quality of your phrases and word selection can be a boon or a weakness in any web design. So, this aspect of SEO plays a role in all instances and sides
                            of optimization.</p>
                        <p>The effectiveness of abiding by these precepts has helped to shape the way in which we use the internet – <em>and content</em> – today, and is by and large the reason why content writing and SEO are almost inseparable from one
                            another.

                    <div class="insights-data-inner custom-scroll">

                        <p>Search Engine Optimization is a discipline that combines skills in the realm of tech, marketing, and social engineering. A particular set that is not easy to come by. Most of the time, whenever you need SEO solutions for your online
                            content your best bet is to hire an SEO/ Digital Marketing agency. Other options are hiring a freelancer/consultant to help you out, or learning to do it yourself.</p>
                        <p>By going with an agency, you’re instantly benefitting from several key advantages that dramatically improve the chances you’ll get the best possible service and the results you want.
                        </p>
                        <p>By hiring an agency, you get to skip out all the time, effort, and harsh lessons you need to go through when learning to do so yourself. On top of that, you get to start benefitting from the improvements made to your content in
                            a shorter timeframe.
                        </p>
                        <p>SEO &amp; Digital Marketing agencies tend to be divided into departments. Each focused on different tasks that come together to form a solid SEO strategy that works to your needs. Not having to depend on a single person to take
                            care of it all makes the process much smoother.</p>
                        <p>When dealing with agencies, you get more tools to gauge quality and legitimacy. Most reputable agencies will have an ample portfolio of clients with references, and samples of the work they’ve already handled, which will give you
                            a reasonably good understanding of what they can do for your business before you even seal the deal.
                        </p>
                        <p>Your second option is to go with a freelancer or a consultant.</p>
                        <p>Most people who decided to go this way do so because they think the service will be more affordable. And while it might appear so on the outset, an unprepared or unqualified freelancer, incapable of handling your project might
                            end up costing much more in the long run.</p>
                        <p>Freelancers are ideal for smaller projects, or to complement SEO efforts you are already handling yourself as an extra source of information and assistance. Most popular freelance sites, like Upwork, have an SEO section where you
                            can contact people offering their services in the field.</p>
                        <p>The two major drawbacks being that gauging the actual expertise the person has might be difficult (
                            <em>particularly if you are on a budget and can’t afford the ones more established</em>,) and that depending on the size of your project, a single person might not be able to take it all on effectively.</p>
                        <p>Lastly, several of the most essential SEO techniques and strategies can be learned by someone with basic tech know-how and implemented effectively to some extent. The main issue is that, just like learning any other complex skills,
                            this route requires a lot of time and efforts, and might not be sustainable in the long run.
                        </p>
                        <p>Whether you decide to go with an agency, a freelancer, or take on your SEO needs yourself, you need to be aware of scams and overpromises. There’s a lot of valuable information and reputable sources out there that can help you
                            get the results you are looking for out of SEO, but there are many others that might cause more problems than they solve. A keen mind is essential in the process of choosing your SEO source, so you can get the results you need.</p>

                        <p>“Google search operators” or “advanced search operators” are special characters used to improve your search. They help you narrow down your query, and they’re useful for any type of search. You can benefit from learning how to
                            use them, whether you need to do a simple content search or a technical SEO audit. Advance search operators are a very powerful tool. They can save you time and help you find exactly what you are looking for.
                        </p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <h3>How do you use search operators?</h3>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>You type them directly into the search bar just as you would type a search term. Some of the basic operators include words such as “OR” and “AND” which most people already use. There are other less common operators that work wonders,
                            making searches more accurate.</p>
                        <p>Here are examples of other basic search operators you probably didn’t know:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Inverted commas (“ ”) to find results for an exact match.</li>
                            <li>Using a minus (-) in front of any term (including operators) excludes them from the results.
                            </li>
                            <li>Using an asterisk (*) as a placeholder for any unknown or wildcard terms.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Some advanced search operators include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>site: it limits the results to those from the specified website.</li>
                            <li>intitle: Search only in the page’s title for a word or phrase.</li>
                            <li>inurl: Find pages with a specific word (or words) in the URL.</li>
                            <li>intext: Find pages containing a particular word (or words) somewhere in the content.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>You can combine basic and advance search operators to narrow your search results even more

                    <h3>What is Above the fold content?</h3>
                    <div class="insights-data-inner custom-scroll">

                        <p>The concept “above the fold” is centuries old. It all started with the early days of the printing press. Back then, newspapers were printed on large paper sheets. They had to be folded when they were displayed on the newsstand,
                            which only made visible the top half of the paper.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>The industry quickly found a way to draw people’s attention using of that visible part of the paper. They had to present eye-catching headlines, images, and content on this top half. This remains true to this day, and now it is
                            applied to digital content. Websites obviously don’t have an actual fold like newspapers do, so the “fold” in the WWW refers to the scrollbar. On a website, everything you see before you need to start scrolling down is what’s
                            known as above the fold content. The part of the page that needs scrolling so you can see the content is called “below the fold.”</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>The amount of information displayed on a web page varies from one website to another. That’s because many variables can affect how a page is viewed. These factors include the device’s display size, the browser used, the operating
                            system, and others.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Why is above the fold content so important?</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Well, first because it’s what visitors will see as soon as the site loads. It prepares visitors for the rest of the content, setting quality expectations. Studies have shown that what appears on the top of a web page affects the
                            user experience. Viewability (50% of an ad’s pixels being on-screen for one second), is nearly 30% higher for ads above the fold. The content above the fold helps your site’s visitors decided if it’s worth their time.</p>

                <div class="insights-data" data-info="What is AdWords?">
                    <h3>What is AdWords?</h3>
                    <div class="insights-data-inner custom-scroll">

                        <p>Google AdWords is now known as Google Ads, and it’s Google’s advertising service. Your website can appear on the top of search results pages (SERPs) by paying for one or several specific keywords. It is known as paid search. This
                            means that your site will appear above the organic searches as a search ad. Google lets users know it’s an ad by adding a small green label that reads “AD.” However, if you are not paying attention, you might mistake it for
                            an organic result. Besides Google, Bing also has its own advertising platform called the Bing Network.</p>
                        <h2>How does it work?</h2>
                        <p>Basically, you choose one or several keywords related to your niche. These terms are the ones think a person searching your products or services might use. Then, you need to create an ad that will appear on the SERPs when people
                            search the terms you chose.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>However, chances are you’re not the only business doing this. Your competitors can bid for the same search terms you do and. So, if you want to appear on the search results, you have to outbid them (paying a higher per-click rate).
                            The more you are willing to pay, the higher the chances you show up in the search results.
                        </p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>That being said, the money you put down is not the only factor determining your spot on the SERPs. Google also assigns an “Ad rank” to determine the order in which paid search ads are shown on the SERPs.</p>
                        <p>Google takes five other factors besides the bid amount when deciding what ads to show users. These factors are:</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>• Auction-time<br>• Landing page quality<br>• Ad Rank thresholds <br>• Search context<br>• The impact of ad extensions</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Topic and nature of the search and user cues (type of device and location) determine Ad Rank thresholds.
                        </p>
                        <p>This process makes sure that both the quality of the ad and the bid amount are considered when displaying the results.</p>

                            through your link. When your audience takes the desired action, you get a commission.</p>
                        <p>Some affiliate networks offer Cost Per Action (CPA) programs. This means that the desired action is not always buying a product or service. It can be filling out a form, downloading a freebie, or opting in to receive a newsletter.</p>
                        <p>Affiliate marketing is a great way for a business to get organic traffic and increase conversion rates.

                    <h3>What is an Algorithm?</h3>
                    <div class="insights-data-inner custom-scroll">

                        <p>Generally speaking, an algorithm is a set process to solve a problem. Algorithms are all about finding solutions, and the faster and easier, the better. Search engines use them to gather information and determine what results to
                            return for a search query.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>When referring to search engines, you will usually read about “THE” algorithm. However, it is actually a set of algorithms that work together to determine how significant a website is for a specific search term or terms.</p>
                        <p>Think of it as a main algorithm and several sub-algorithms and formulas. The main algorithm is the one that determines how the others are considered to produce the results you see on a SERP when you search for something.</p>
                        <p>Each search engine has its own set of rules (algorithms and sub-algorithms). And they work together to “decide” what results we see when we look for something online.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>These set of rules is also what determines whether a site is spam or not and if it as relevant and useful information for potential visitors. Algorithms also rank websites according to their content. This means that the order in
                            which results are delivered is also determined by these. As search engines have evolved, algorithms have too. They work to present us with the most relevant results whenever we enter a search query and, as such, have changed
                            technology advances.
                        </p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>A simple example of how algorithms work is mobile searches. Nowadays, a great deal of searches is done via mobile devices. So, given two sites that have the exact same content, an algorithm will present you those that are mobile-friendly
                            before those that are not.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>It is important to note that search engines are always looking to present users with the results that are closer to what they are looking for and those that offer a good user experience. That is what’s behind all the periodic updates
                            and changes done to these formulas.</p>

                    <div class="insights-data-inner custom-scroll">

                        <p>Alt text stands for alternative text. It is also known as alt attributes or alt descriptions. You will also find it as alt tags, though this is technically incorrect.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Alt text is used a part of an HTML code used to describe the appearance of an image on a page. They provide a context and image descriptions so search engines can index it properly.
                        </p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Alt text is used to make the web more accessible. People who are visually impaired and use screen readers can have the software read the alt text to gain a better understanding of the page.
                        </p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Alt attributes will be displayed when an image file cannot be loaded.</p>
                        <p>Using alternative text in your images makes it possible for all users to understand what the content of your site is whether they have limited use internet, or have a visual disability. Alt text improves user experience, and that
                            is always good for SEO. But beyond that, it provides crawlers with the necessary information to classify your site’s visual content. This allows search engines to index it properly and rank your website for the correct keywords.
                        </p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>What makes alt text good? This is what Google has to say about it:</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>“When choosing alt text, focus on creating useful, information-rich content that uses keywords appropriately and is in context of the content of the page. Avoid filling alt attributes with keywords (keyword stuffing) as it results
                            in a negative user experience and may cause your site to be seen as spam.”</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>If when you read it, you can picture the image in your mind, then you have created a good alt text. If you can seamlessly incorporate one of your keywords in it, even better. However, remember that spamming is heavily frowned upon
                            by search engines. So, if you already have a good keyword density in your text, there is no need to overdo it.</p>

                    <div class="insights-data-inner custom-scroll">

                        <p>AMP stands for Accelerated Mobile Pages. It refers to a project developed by Google to improve the experience of end-users.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Have you ever entered a website and been forced to waste minutes of your life waiting for the page to load? It is super frustrating, right? In today’s world, speed is critical to keep customers happy. A slow response in a website
                            can make you lose potential clients.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>With that in mind, Google came up with a way to speeds up the response of the website, improving the user experience. AMP can make your website’s pages load faster for mobile users. This can help you keep your customers happy while
                            standing out in Google’s result pages.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>The format looks to create optimized versions of the original pages by removing any function that might be slowing them down. Some of the functionalities of the page might be limited for the sake of speed.</p>
                        <p>In more technical words, the code of the page is cleaned and modified according to Google’s Content Delivery Network to make sure the page will load faster on mobile devices.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>AMP format has become popular since Google announced its new policy of mobile-first index. It will slightly boost your rankings, giving your website a better chance to appear in the first result pages.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Make sure to follow Google’s specifications to implement the format correctly. You will need to have alternative versions of your pages for the AMP format. It means that your original versions will coexist with your non-AMP pages.
                            Google also recommends tracking your pages separately in Google Analytics; that way, you’ll be able to see the difference between both formats.</p>

                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Content is still the king of any online business. However, creating engaging and relevant content is not enough to increase your website’s traffic. Guiding people towards your content is as important as writing top-notch pieces.
                        </p>
                        <p>The first step is to create interesting and useful content that people will love to read. Distribution increases your chances of being seen. But it will be the quality of the content you share that will make people stay on your

                        <p>Content amplification is not a single technique. It’s a mix of different strategies to ensure your content is visible to your target audience. Keep in mind that the most powerful search engines and social media channels prioritize

                        <p>A good strategy could be to distribute all your content through different platforms, but be wise and pay to amplify only your top content, the one you know will drive the most traffic to your website.
                        </p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Influencer marketing is another good strategy to amplify your content. Contact social media influencers within your target audience. They can provide great exposure for your brand.</p>

                        <p>Regardless of the strategy you decide to apply, make sure you use the right tools to determine what channel works better for your niche and type of content.</p>

                        <p>In the simplest words, anchor text is the clickable text that links to another page within the same site or another site online.</p>
                        <p>Anchor texts have been widely used as part of a strong SEO strategy. It creates the opportunity to have leads and increase the organic traffic to your website. However, they are also an easy way to be banned by Google for over
                            linking pages.
                        </p>
                        <p>There are several types of anchor text. These include branded anchors, naked link anchors, and generic anchors. You can also find LSI anchors. These kinds of anchors use variations of the main keyword.</p>
                        <p>Branded anchors use the name of the brand as anchor text.</p>
                        <p>Naked anchors use the URL directly within the text.</p>
                        <p>Generic anchors use common terms to link to a page, for example “click here”, “this website”, and “more info”.</p>
                        <p>Another type of anchor text has nothing to do with the text itself but with the image. As you know, images cannot be seen as text, but Google reads the Alt Text of any image as anchor text.
                        </p>
                        <p>A good link building strategy includes different types of anchor text distributed wisely throughout the content. Remember that anchor texts must always be relevant, and most importantly, they should never link to spammy websites.

                        <p>API stands for Application Programming Interface. It consists of a set of functions and procedures that allow access to features of an operating system. In simpler words, APIs are two applications communicating with each other.
                            Even though it looks like a fancy and complicated concept, most people have used APIs.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Every time you have used an app on your phone, this app sends your request to the internet and then to a server. The server receives the input, processes it, and sends the answer back to your phone’s app. The app displays it in
                            readable language for you. This is the generic definition in the computing field. Now, let’s take a look at the term in the SEO world.</p>
                        <p>An API is designed to help business owners see and analyze all the information about their website. It provides marketers, webmasters, and SEO specialists data from the interactions between a site and the users in a condensed way.
                        </p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>APIs are very popular today because of their fast access to the information and easy-to-use features. They provide real-time information. This information includes number of visitors, link building status, social media interaction,
                            percentage of organic traffic, tracking the leads, etc. This data lets owners see the performance of their business and the results of their SEO strategies.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>This tool is very convenient for those who want to see the data right in their browser without having to enter any SEO platform.</p>
                        <p>Most SEO platforms have their own API to ease the process of accessing data. It would be very difficult to point which one is the best. They all offer different interfaces and features that adapt to different clients, depending
                            on their needs and objectives. However, APIs have proved to be the fastest way to access the information and make decisions over marketing strategies.</p>

                    <div class="insights-data-inner custom-scroll">
                        <p>Async is short for asynchronous and refers to the process of loading individually the resources of a web page. Let’s break this concept down.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>A resource is every item included in a web page: Images, text (HTML pages), cascading style sheets (CCS), they are all resources. For users to see the web page as it was designed and enjoy all the features and functionalities,
                            the resources must be totally downloaded. In the past, every resource downloaded sequentially, which means that one resource had to be downloaded entirely for the second to start downloading, and so on.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>It worked perfectly for those early years on the web. However, things have slightly changed ever since. Nowadays, businesses depend significantly on SEO to succeed in the online world. In other words, they must provide customers
                            with a great user experience to achieve the highest ranking possible in the search engine result pages.
                        </p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>One of the main aspects of good user experience is the loading speed of a website. That is when asynchronous resources enter.</p>

                        <p>Each page can have a different amount of resources. The more resources within a web page, the heavier it is to load.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>One technique to speed up the load process is by using asynchronous resource loading. It means loading every resource individually. It will surely help users see and use the page faster. But remember that users are not the only
                            ones browsing your website, so are web crawlers.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Bots, also known as web crawlers, are responsible for the analysis of your website to decide if it is appropriately optimized. They have a massive impact on your website ranking. So, it is crucial that they receive the same information
                            as your users. Make sure your web pages are equally fast to download for end users and for web crawlers to ensure a higher ranking.</p>

                    <h3>What is an Authority Site?</h3>
                    <div class="insights-data-inner custom-scroll">
                        <p>An authority site is a respectable site among other websites in its industry. The main feature of these sites is the high-quality content and a significant amount of incoming links. It becomes a reference for other websites in
                            similar niches.
                        </p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>A good example of an authority site would be Wikipedia. More often than not, Wikipedia is among the top results of the most popular search engines. The reason? It has relevant information about a huge range of topics, and every
                            page is backed up by references of other respectable sites.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>The goal of authority sites is to offer useful information about their niche. They must answer their users’ questions and make them want to share it with others. Authority sites should cover their topic thoroughly by providing
                            only trustworthy information.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>They commonly rank higher than other sites because they become a tool or a resource for users. Another important characteristic of authority sites is that they target a very specific audience, and cover every aspect of their topic
                            of interest.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>These content-driven sites have high traffic coming from different channels. So, there is a very high chance of becoming profitable for their owners.</p>
                        <p>Educative sites are easy to build, and more importantly, they don’t try to push any sell to customers. Content-driven websites are a great way to start an online business. They can be launched for an affordable price and become
                            revenue monsters.
                        </p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>But the job is not over once you’ve reached the top results in the search engines. It is crucial to keep the ranking by constantly optimizing your website. Web crawlers frequently browse your site to check it’s still relevant and
                            offers a good user experience. Depending on your niche, it might be necessary to refresh and update its content to keep it that way.</p>

                    <div class="insights-data-inner custom-scroll">
                        <p>Automatically generated content or auto-generated content is produced using software. This is done with little or no human involvement in the process. Most of the times, it makes no sense and is not useful at all.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>A significant part of today’s online business success depends on SEO. SEO is based on giving a good user experience to website visitors. The level of optimization on a website is measured by its pages loading speed, user-friendly
                            features, content relevance.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Content is at the top of the ranking factors pyramid. It has to be relevant, useful, and original for a site to rank high in the results.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Auto-generated content is not relevant, not useful, and definitely, not original. So, it can severely hurt your website ranking and even lead to banishment.</p>
                        <p>Google has some strict standards regarding their optimized content policy. Its web crawlers can identify what content provides real help to the users and which has been introduced to manipulate search ranking. Just in case you’re
                            wondering what Google considers auto-generated content, here are some examples:</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>• Content that makes no sense at all<br>• Information that has been translated using software with no revision of human editors<br>• Content that has been copy-pasted from other sites
                            <br>• Text which has been stitched together from different sources without using any reference
                            <br>• Keyword-rich text with no relevant information
                        </p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <h2>Why is auto-generated content so harmful to SEO purposes?</h2>
                        <p>The sake of having an optimized site is to provide help to users. Humans are not interested in reading useless text. They want answers, tips, and solutions to their online query. Auto-generated content is just a shallow attempt
                            to rank higher without taking users’ satisfaction into account. It is a strong reason to be banned by search engines.</p>

                    <h3>What does “10 Blue links” refer to?</h3>
                    <div class="insights-data-inner custom-scroll">
                        <p>The phrase “10 blue links” is an expression in the world of SEO used to refer to the traditional format of presenting search results.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>It used to be that, when you entered a query on your search engine of choice, the site came back with 10 blue link entries as suggestions. Now, you might be thinking that that remains the way the biggest search engine around –
                            Google – works. The fact is that the search titan, who held to the tradition longer than most, has discretely moved beyond it.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Yes, through the years, Google has kept to a pretty consistent format of presenting its search results. Namely, a list of blue links deemed to most closely match your query and the information you want to access. However, search
                            for any famous artist right now on their engine, and you’ll notice the information goes way beyond the titular links.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>A news block usually heads the page, and probably a profile immediately to its right side. A handful of links followed by another block – this one with videos – and then the rest of the result list.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>It’s far from surprising, really. As search engines continue to evolve and new devices and techs get in play, a barebones interface might not address most users’ needs.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <h2>Why is the expression “10 Blue links” still relevant?</h2>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>For years, it was used by competing services to Google – like Bing and Yahoo – as a jive, pointing to an “outdated” way of displaying results. For them, moving away from the simple “10 blue links” format was a way to stand out.
                        </p>
                        <p>Today, it remains an expression you might read on SEO-related content, most often used simply to refer to SERPs.</p>

                <div class="insights-data" data-info="What is Bounce rate?">
                    <h3>What is Bounce rate?</h3>
                    <div class="insights-data-inner custom-scroll">
                        <p>Bounce rates refer to one of the most used, and most important website traffic analytics used in SEO to determine a site’s performance. A “bounce” alludes to a person that gets to your site and leaves without further interacting
                            with other pages.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Bounce rates, then, are the percentage of people who get into your site and immediately leave. It is calculated by taking all the single-page sessions your website gets and dividing that number by the number of total sessions received.
                        </p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Generally speaking, high bounce rates are considered a bad thing, while low bounce rates tend to be desirable. Having said that, there’s a bit more to unpack than just that.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <h2>Is a high bounce rate always bad?</h2>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>More often than not, yes.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Very rarely does a website success hinges on viewers interacting with a single page, but in such cases, a high bounce rate would make sense. Like it happens with some blogs. However, if your site works as most do, using landing
                            pages to “convert” visitors making them visit other parts of the site, then high bounce rates are bad.
                        </p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Some studies suggest that average bounce rates sit around 58%. However, B2B sites tend to see higher rates than B2C oriented ones.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <h2>How to optimize for lower bounce rates?</h2>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Decreasing a site’s bounce rates are one of the most common optimization tasks you’ll want to undertake.
                        </p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Your site-wide bounce rate is too broad of a metric to be readily usable. Instead, it’s a good practice to study your demographics and analyze how they respond to different parts of your content. Study your site and try to come
                            up with a few hypotheses on what may be causing such demographics to leave before taking action. Then, set yourself specific goals, conduct some A/B testing modifying elements that might affect the results and track the performance.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Before long, you should start noticing changes in your site’s bounce rates and can tweak aspects of your content accordingly.</p>

                    <h3>What is a Broken link?</h3>
                    <div class="insights-data-inner custom-scroll">
                        <p>Broken links, also known as dead links, are hyperlinks on your website that for some reason no longer direct to their intended destination. Broken links are a problem for two main reasons:
                            <br>• They tarnish UX: The quality of your content is a reflection of your online persona. When a user clicks on a link in your site and gets a 404-error page, they might get frustrated and never come back.<br>• They undermine
                            Optimization: Broken links affect the way link equity flows through your website. This, in turn, can negatively affect your rankings.</p>
                        <p>When your site encounters a broken link, it usually is caused by one of these reasons:<br>– The wrong link was entered when you created the link.<br>– The destination site removed the page being linked to.<br>– The destination
                            site’s URL structure changed.<br>– The destination site no longer exists or has permanently moved to a new address without properly redirecting.<br>– The user has some software (like a firewall) that’s blocking his access to
                            the linked site.
                            <br>– The link is pointed to a site behind a firewall which prevents unauthorized outside access (such as an Intranet.)</p>
                        <p>It is a good practice to run periodical checks for broken links on your entire site, which might sound more complicated than it really is.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <h2>How to fix broken links on your site</h2>
                        <p>Here’s a simple checklist you can apply whenever it’s time to diagnose your site’s broken link situation and deal with it:</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <h2>Step 1 – Find All the Broken Links</h2>
                        <p>Even though this sounds like the hardest part, it’s actually not. There are plenty of useful, free tools you can use to help you pinpoint any broken link on your website. For example, Google Analytics.
                        </p>
                        <p>Log into your account, set the evaluation period according to your needs – Specifically, since the last time you ran this check. Then go to Content – Content by Title on the dashboard, and load the page. At the bottom, create a
                            filter by typing the title of your 404-error page in the box after “Filter page title: Containing” and then click Go. Once you click on the page title, you’ll see the details of how many times that page was visited and via
                            what pages.</p>
                        <h2>Step 2 – Create a Report</h2>
                        <p>Now that you have identified the broken links create a list (like an Excel spreadsheet) to track your redirect process. If you are following along, Google Analytics lets you export the results of your search.</p>
                        <p>Once you know where the issues are, you can go about solving them!</p>
                        <h2>Step 3 – Figure out problems and Prioritize</h2>
                        <p>You know which links have issues, but not all links are equal! Some error links might come from human error (users mistyping a URL), while others will be pages with a lot of visits. Give more important pages’ priority and figure
                            out why they are broken. Figure out the correct address they should be directing to, and you are almost there.</p>
                        <h2>Step 4 – Apply fixes</h2>
                        <p>Grab your content management system and start redirecting the broken links to their rightful URLs. Done!</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Remember that repairing broken links is an important (and ongoing!) optimization task. Don’t leave it unattended for too long.</p>

                    <h3>What is a Blog?</h3>
                    <div class="insights-data-inner custom-scroll">
                        <p>A blog is essentially a type of website that originated from the format many online journals had back when the internet was new. It is characterized by having its content presented in reverse chronological order, meaning that newer
                            content appears first.</p>
                        <p>They are primarily used as content delivery platforms, most often including texts – called “Blog posts” – images, videos, and animated gifs.</p>
                        <p>Initially, they came about as a way for people to share their content with others. Following a very basic mechanic: You posted a new entry on your blog, people read it and commented on it, and then you got to interact with through
                            comments.
                        </p>
                        <p>It is a basic formula that remains alive even to this day. That being said, blogs today tend to be a bit more involved and provide many more opportunities than just interacting through comments.
                        </p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <h2>What makes Blogs different from regular websites?</h2>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Blogs and websites hold differences in both form and function.</p>
                        <p>Websites tend to be static – for the most part – digital platforms where people can visit and take different actions. They are usually designed to get visitors to take one or more specific actions to the benefit of the owners.
                            They are broad.</p>
                        <p>Blogs, on the other hand, tend to be very dynamic content-wise. Yes, they usually follow a design too, but these tend to be much more straightforward. Their main attribute remains a centric stream of information sorted reverse-chronologically,
                            and their focus is more content distribution-oriented.</p>
                        <p>Nowhere is this better appreciated than in users’ expectations.</p>
                        <p>While users have grown to love (and expect) a certain minimum level of polish in their sites (design-wise), they tend to be much more forgiving with blogs’ layouts.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <h2>What is a blog from an SEO point of view?</h2>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Blogs are amazing inbound marketing tools, which is probably why having corporate blogs has become such a widespread strategy among companies. They are platforms teeming with optimization opportunities that help them rank in SERPs.
                        </p>
                        <p>When done right, a blog can be a constant source of leads. Drawing eyes to your content that can then be redirected to a website or the rest of your online presence.</p>

                        <p>An excellent way to truly understanding the concept is to take a look at some of the most popular (and important) implementations of bots right now.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <h2>Types of Bots</h2>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>• Web Crawler: Arguably one of the most relevant kinds of bots right now, these bots are an integral piece of how the internet functions. Web crawlers – also known as “spiders” – are automated scripts in charge of fetching, analyzing,
                            and indexing information from web servers. A process which is closely tied to SEO.<br>• Text-reading Algorithms: Another commonly used type of bot, these programs pour over excessive amounts of text and analyze it according
                            to pre-established criteria. They help social media networks and news outlets filter comments, for example, and flag/exclude offensive content.<br>• Chatbots: Also known as chatterbots or talkbots, Chatbots are one of the most
                            recognizable types of bots online today. If you have ever interacted with a site that offers you help through an online chat, chances are that you have bumped into one of these. They are programmed to simulate a human interlocutor
                            and conduct a conversation on specific topics.<br>• Game bots: Probably best known to younger readers, these are bots programmed to carry out a task on a video game. Often seen under a negative light – as they automatize functions
                            that should be challenging to users – they are nonetheless an impressive use of A.I. tech.
                        </p>
                        <h2>Are bots bad?</h2>
                        <p>As with happens with every other piece of technology, bots are not inherently bad or good. As you’ve read, many provide essential functions that help things run smoothly. Having said that, it is possible to program these pieces
                            of software for ill-intended purposes.</p>

                    <div class="insights-data-inner custom-scroll">
                        <p>Backlink is a term often used in the SEO community to describe any incoming links to a website. This means that whenever a site creates a hyperlink connecting it to another site, it creates a backlink.
                        </p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>They are a ubiquitous term in search engine optimization due to their significance then and now.
                        </p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>It used to be that backlinks were the number one metric used by search engines to rank websites. The assumption was that if many sites were pointing to a particular one, that site held valuable information that people would like
                            to see. Thus, pages with a lot of backlinks tended to rank higher on all major search engines. Google included.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>While search algorithms have significantly evolved since then, backlinks remain an essential piece of the optimization game, and a lot of SEO’s terminology reflects it.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <h2>Popular Backlink nomenclature, tied to SEO</h2>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>• Link Juice: A popular phrase used in this context, it denotes a site conveying credibility and relevance when it links to another. It is often seen in the context of domain authority.
                            <br>• No-follow Links: It refers to backlinks that use the HTML “no-follow” tag. This tag instructs WebCrawler’s not to index the destination of the link, thus not conveying any “link juice.”<br>• Internal Links: Links that
                            point to other parts of the same site.<br>• Low-quality Links: It refers to backlinks that come from undesirable sites. Pages like harvested sites, automated sites, spam sites, or even porn sites can fall on this category.<br>•
                            Anchor texts: Refers to the words used to place a hyperlink on.

                    <div class="insights-data-inner custom-scroll">
                        <p>In SEO, breadcrumbs are links that let users track their path from the page they are currently viewing on your site, to your homepage. They are an important piece of a well-designed website, as these navigational aids help improve
                            user experience while helping search engines understand your site’s structure.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>They are usually located at the top of a website and denote a users’ position relative to the home page. A typical breadcrumb might look like:</p>
                        <p>Home &gt;&gt; Blog &gt;&gt; What are Breadcrumbs.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>With each instance along the path being a clickable link that aids navigation.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <h2>Types of Breadcrumbs</h2>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Breadcrumbs are often classified into three types.</p>
                        <p>• Location breadcrumbs: In website navigation structure today, they tell the position of a page within the site’s hierarchy. They help users visit a page that hosts similar sites.
                            <br>• Path breadcrumbs: These are probably the most common type, and the one discussed above. They show the path a user has taken through your site.
                            <br>• Keyword breadcrumbs: Similar to location breadcrumbs, they use keywords instead of page titles. Most often seen in e-commerce websites.
                        </p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <h2>Breadcrumbs, UX, and SEO</h2>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>It doesn’t take much to see why breadcrumbs are useful to users. They give them an extra way to orient themselves in your content, and navigate it more efficiently, letting the retrace their path or navigating to similar pages.
                            The results of smoother navigation through a site is often an improved UX.</p>
                        <p>On the SEO side, breadcrumbs give crawlers easy access to the inner and outer pages of your site. They can also be used to relate individual pages to specific keywords and improve the internal linking structure.</p>

                        <p>A bad idea.</p>
                        <p>Black hat SEO is a blanket term referring to an assortment of search engine optimization practices that are either frowned upon or outright forbidden by most search engines. These practices are intended to trick search engine algorithms
                            into ranking pages higher on SERPs, not based on quality but technicalities.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>This is a big no-no to most search engines since it runs directly against their primary focus: Delivering accurate, useful, and quality results to their users. Search engines actively hunt and penalize sites engaging in these practices,
                            so they are best avoided altogether.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Black hat SEO is most often associated with shady or scammy businesses and services, as it is known to hold no long-term effectiveness.</p>

                        <h2>What are some common black hat SEO practices?</h2>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>It is useful to be at least aware of the most common practices in black hat SEO so that you can avoid them entirely. Some of these are:<br>• Content Automation.<br>• Doorway Pages.
                            <br>• Hidden texts or links.<br>• Keyword stuffing.
                            <br>• Sneaky redirects.<br>• Link Schemes.<br>• Link Farms.<br>And the list goes on…</p>

                        <p>While not illegal, black hat SEO does violate the webmaster’s guidelines set out by search engines. This makes BHSEO a losing proposition in the long run.</p>
                        <p>Even if a site were to experience a boost in traffic for a short time, search engines are getting more and more effective at hunting them down. They actively search and punish websites engaged in these practices, and the penalties
                            can be devastating. Nowadays, if you participate in black hat SEO, getting caught is just a matter of time.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>It is not uncommon for a site caught using black hat SEO to plummet in SERPs, or even getting removed entirely from the index.</p>

                    <div class="insights-data-inner custom-scroll">
                        <p>To have your site de-indexed means to have it either be temporary or permanently taken out from search engine rankings – In other words, no matter what search term a person uses, a de-indexed site will never appear on SERPs.</p>
                        <p>Search engines like Google are constantly sending out bots called web crawlers, whose sole function is to navigate content and record what they find. This information is then organized and stored on the search engine’s “

                        <p>Search engines don’t fetch results from the internet in real time. Their algorithms match users’ queries to these extensive indexes and select from them the results to be shown.</p>
                        <p>A de-indexed site receives no such web crawlers and does not appear on a search engine’s index, so it can’t appear in search results.</p>
                        <p>De-indexing can be imposed as a penalty by search engines due to wrongful practices, or voluntarily by a site webmaster.</p>
                        <h2>Why would someone de-index their own site?</h2>
                        <p>While seemingly counter-intuitive, there are several possible reasons for someone to want to prevent their site from being crawled or indexed.<br>• Duplicate content: Search engines typically penalize websites that contain duplicate
                            content. De-indexing the duplicates is an alternative to avoid being flagged for it.<br>• Outdated content: Content that is no longer current, but that you wish to keep for any reason (reference, plans to update, etc.) should
                            probably be de-indexed. Sites might want to prevent people from landing on terribly outdated pages and having the wrong impression from their content.<br>• Gated Content: Pages that contain data that should only be accessible
                            after providing some information or payment are best kept de-indexed most of the time.<br>• Pages with little or no content: Confirmation pages in e-commerce platforms are a perfect example of this instance. If you have pages
                            that are there just to provide a step on a process that adds little else, it’s probably best to de-indexed it.</p>

                        <p>In the realm of local SEO, distance refers to the proximity of a search result, to the point where the search originated from. Distance is believed to be one of the most critical factors that come in play when ranking for platforms

                        <p>While regular SERPs rely mostly on indicators like quality/authority, diversity of inbound links, and keyword relevance, distance seems to supersede those for things like Google Local Pack and Maps.
                        </p>
                        <p>Other essential elements to rank for local SEO are:<br>• Proper category associations for a business’ profile.<br>• Consistency in citations.<br>• Physical address.<br>• Completeness of a business listing.<br>• Verification of
                            listing.

                        <p>Experimentation goes a long way to show the role that distance and proximity play in location-based search engine results.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Taking Google as an example, localized organic results (the blue links shown in the regular list) still seem to rank based on traditional factors. They remain somewhat consistent regardless of distance.

                                within or across domains that either completely match other content or are appreciably
                                similar.</em>”</p>
                        <p>Having duplicate does not automatically earn a penalty, but it can affect a site’s rankings.
                        </p>
                        <p>Search engines tend to dislike duplicate content since it presents a lot of challenges:<br>• Determining which version of the content to include or keep out of their indexes.<br>• Determining how to allocate link metrics.<br>•
                            Determining which version should be ranked in SERPs.</p>
                        <h2>When is duplicate content bad?</h2>
                        <p>When someone purposely takes, copy, and slightly alter content to manipulate search engine rankings. Google calls this “<em>copied content</em>.” This is the type of practice that might trigger penalties.</p>
                        <p>From Google: “<em>Duplicate content on a site is not grounds for action on that site unless
                                it
                                appears that the intent of the duplicate content is to be deceptive and manipulate
                                search
                                engine results</em>”</p>
                        <p>Depending on your actions, you can have duplicate content on a site without it being considered as “<em>deceptive in origin.</em>”</p>
                        <h2>How to prevent issues with duplicate content?</h2>
                        <p>There are a few practices that can help you fix or prevent duplicate content issues:<br>• Setting up a 301 redirect from the duplicate content page to where the original content is hosted.
                            <br>• Using the rel=canonical attribute, which instructs search engines to treat a page as a copy of a specified URL.<br>• Using meta robots with the values “noindex, follow” in the HTML head to de-index a duplicate content
                            page.
                            <br>• Configuring a preferred domain and specify robot parameter crawling in Google Search Console.

                    <div class="insights-data-inner custom-scroll">
                        <p>A Domain or domain name is a term used to refer to a website’s unique, human-readable identifier or “<em>address</em>.” They are comprised of three parts: A top-level domain, a domain name proper, and an optional subdomain.</p>
                        <p>Technically speaking, “<em>Domain</em>” refers to the three elements together, while “
                            <em>Domain
                                name</em>” indicates the middle part.</p>
                        <p>Top-level domains must be registered with the Web Internet Registry, and a yearly fee is required to maintain the registry.</p>
                        <h2>The pieces of a domain name</h2>
                        <p>T<strong>op-level Domain (TLD)</strong>: This is the official designation to the suffix at the end of a domain name. The most recognizable being: .com, .net, .org, and .edu. However, there are over 1000 other possible TLDs to choose
                            from. Some designate territories (.<em>ca for Canada)</em> or even things (<em>like
                                .book)</em>
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Domain name:</strong> This is the second level of a domain’s hierarchy. Domain names are usually purchased from a registrar –<em> a company that manages the reservation of
                                domain
                                names</em> – and represent the unique and specific location of a site.</p>
                        <p><strong>Subdomain:</strong> This is the third level of hierarchy on a domain, added in front of the others. The “www” is the subdomain.</p>
                        <h2>What’s a root domain?</h2>
                        <p>Initially created in the context of DNS (<em>domain name servers</em>), it is a term used to designate the combination of a domain name and a top-level domain. Root domains form a complete website address and are usually where
                            your home page is located.“<em>overthetopseo.com</em>” would be this website’s root domain.

                    <h3>What is Domain Authority?</h3>
                    <div class="insights-data-inner custom-scroll">
                        <p>Domain authority (DA), also known as thought leadership, is a concept that refers to a website’s “
                            <em>relevance</em>.” Presumably, search engines algorithms place a lot of importance on this aspect of a site, which directly affects its ranking.</p>
                        <p>It is often described as consisting of four main aspects: Prestige of a website and its authors, quality of its information, centrality (amount of unidirectional connections), and the competitiveness of its niche.</p>
                        <h2>Domain authority and MOZ</h2>
                        <p>Usually, when most people reference domain authority, they are actually referring to Moz’s DA rank. An algorithm and metric that accounts for interpretations of DA’s aspects, to predict a website’s performance in SERPs.</p>
                        <p>By looking at the domains that point to a site, the number of inbound links, and other proprietary characteristics, Moz assigns sites a number between 0 and 100. This number is supposed to mirror the appraisal that search engines
                            – like Google – have for the site, thus suggesting its likelihood of ranking.</p>
                        <p>Moz’s DA rank is meant to be used in a comparative setting. A standalone rank – without context – is meaningless.</p>
                        <h2>Domain authority and Google rankings</h2>
                        <p>Google has reiterated on several occasions that they do not account for such a thing as domain authority. At least not as a single aspect.</p>
                        <p>Google considers over 200 different variables when deciding which links go above which others. A page’s content and inbound links are chief among those, followed most likely by RankBrain in importance.
                        </p>
                        <p>Nevertheless, DA has its optimization uses and can be taken as a general quality gauge most of the time.</p>

                    <h3>What are Directory links?</h3>
                    <div class="insights-data-inner custom-scroll">
                        <p>Directory links refer to links that originate in a web directory – <em>also called link
                                directories</em> – that act as list or catalogs of websites.</p>
                        <p>Although still in use, web directories and directory links are legacy elements from the early internet. As their name implies, they were used to list entries of people or businesses online, such as their homepage address and contact
                            information.
                        </p>
                        <p>Web directories today also tend to include entries about a website that contains links to their content, organized into categories and subcategories. Besides a link, entries can also have the page’s title and a summary of its content.
                        </p>
                        <p>In most link directories, entries cover entire websites rather than their individual pages. For organizational purposes, most sites are eligible for inclusion in only a handful of categories within a directory.</p>
                        <p>The initial idea behind web directories is to provide an alternative way to find information online by browsing topics instead of searching by keywords. Today, most directories allow for searches within their database.</p>
                        <h2>Directory links and SEO</h2>
                        <p>Submitting a website to web directories is a common SEO practice, with the intention to get backlinks in the form of directory links to the site. It cannot be made automatically, requiring manual input on behalf of the site’s webmaster,
                            which can be a time-consuming process.</p>
                        <p>In the past, Google employees have talked discouragingly about directory links, stating that “
                            <em>directories are very often not the right way to build links</em>.” So, the extent of their usefulness is debated.</p>

                        <p>A Dead-end page is a webpage on your site with no outgoing links. They include no header or footer links, no main navigation sections, and no breadcrumbs, thus creating a dead end. Such pages give users no further navigation options
                            other than backtracking to where they landed from, or manually inputting a new address.</p>
                        <p>Dead-end pages are synonymous to bad user experience. They truncate navigation through your content and increase the chances of a visitor leaving. However, with so many templates and accessible web development tools available today,
                            genuinely dead-end pages are relatively uncommon.</p>
                        <h2>Fixing a Dead-end page</h2>
                        <p>While potentially very detrimental for UX, dead-end pages can be easily fixed:<br>• Add a main navigation menu that links back to your home or other parts of your site.<br>• Use a sidebar, header, or footer that enables them to
                            go back to a previous page, or move forward to a new one.</p>

                    <div class="insights-data-inner custom-scroll">
                        <p>A deep link refers to a hyperlink that directs to a specific – generally searchable and indexed – page on a website instead of the site’s home — for example, linking to “<a href="seo-services.html">https://www.overthetopseo.com/seo-services/</a>”
                            instead of “<a href="http://www.overthetopseo.com">www.overthetopseo.com.</a>“</p>

                        <h2>Deep link disadvantages</h2>
                        <p>While a common practice, some commercial websites object to other sites providing deep links to their content. It is an understandable concern for several reasons depending on the site’s monetization scheme, as deep links allow
                            people to:
                        </p>
                        <p>• Bypass advertisements on the main pages.<br>• Might suggest the content belongs to the site providing the link.<br>• Provide access to content behind paywalls or some other conditions.
                        </p>
                        <p>Deep linking has led to companies taking legal action in the past, but it remains a common practice.
                        </p>
                        <p>A site that doesn’t want search engines to deep link, or only wants to index specific pages, can do so by utilizing the Robots Exclusion Standard.</p>
                        <h2>Deep linking and SEO</h2>
                        <p>As unfavorable as deep links can be to some monetization structures, they provide some significant benefits from an SEO standpoint.</p>
                        <p>Using deep links:<br>• Tends to lower bounce rates.<br>• Improves UX.<br>• Lead to more comprehensive indexing by search engines.<br>• Create clear paths between particular pieces of content and a user’s click destination.</p>

                        <p>In SEO, disavow usually refers to the action of rejecting or discarding harmful backlinks to your site. It is an available action in Google Search Console that can help you fix, or prevent your site from getting, a manual action.</p>

                        <p>Disavowing, then, removes harmful links from Google’s consideration.</p>
                        <h2>When to use Google’s disavow tool?</h2>
                        <p>You might want to disavow malicious links when:<br>• Your site receives a manual penalty.
                            <br>• Your site receives an algorithmic penalty.<br>• When you detect toxic backlinks on your site’s link profile.</p>

                        <p>Usually, Google does a good job of figuring out which links to trust without additional input, so you won’t be using this tool regularly. Try and only use the tool when you believe your site has a considerable number of spammy,
                            artificial, or low-quality links, or to remove links that triggered a manual action.</p>
                        <p>To use the tool, just put together a list with all the links you want to disavow in a text file, and upload that file on the disavow link tool page.</p>
                        <p>Do keep in mind that it can take a few weeks for Google to process the information you uploaded.

                        <p>Do-follow is an attribute that hyperlinks can have in HTML code. As opposed to the “

                        <h2>Do-follow links and SEO</h2>
                        <p>Within the SEO community, it is common to state that do-follow links provide “<em>link

                        <p>To most search engine algorithms, links function – <em>among other things</em> – as votes for quality. These algorithms make a note of sites that are continually being linked to, and factor that information when considering how
                            highly a website should rank in SERPs.</p>
                        <p>No-follow links don’t provide this advantage and are mainly there just for the users’ benefit.
                        </p>
                        <p>In HTML, a do-follow link would have this format:</p>

                        <p>Doorway pages – <em>bridge pages, portal pages, jump pages</em> – is a name given to pages explicitly designed for ranking benefits. Their sole purpose is to rank highly for specific search queries, and they are fully developed

                        <p>A doorway page affects the indexes of search engines by inserting results for specific phrases. They send users to a different page than expected or to intermediate sites that aren’t as useful; without the user’s knowledge and

                        </p>
                        <p>Using doorway pages is considered a black hat SEO practice and search engines like Google penalize it.</p>
                        <p><strong>Common examples of doorway pages:</strong><br>• Using multiple domains – or pages targeting specific locations – that funnel all users into the same destination.<br>• Pages generated just to funnel visitors to the actually
                            useful portion of your site.<br>• Extremely similar pages that are closer to search results than a clearly defined, browsable hierarchy.</p>
                        <h2>Why are doorway pages frown upon by search engines?</h2>
                        <p>On paper, doorway pages might not sound as damaging as other black hat SEO strategies. In practice, though, doorway pages severely hinder search engines ability to deliver high-quality results to its users consistently.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, they also impact user experience and navigation quality, often requiring users to take an extra step to find the information they are looking for. Lastly, being designed entirely pursuing ranking benefits also means

                        <p>Search engines place a lot of importance into the duration of these sessions. After all, the time spent by a user on a site consuming its content can be directly linked to the value the user found there.</p>
                        <p>Alongside Bounce Rates and Time on Page, dwell time is often cited as an important metric in many optimization strategies.</p>
                        <h2>Dwell time and Google</h2>
                        <p>There’s some debate among many SEOs about the extent of the importance Google places on this metric. On their end, Google has neither confirmed nor denied any ascribed importance to dwell time.
                        </p>
                        <p>However, there have been instances where Google employees suggest its relevance. Mainly by how they are training their machine-learning algorithm – <em>RankBrain</em> – to pay attention to when a user clicks on a page, remains
                            there, and when they go back.</p>
                        <h2>Improving Dwell Time</h2>
                        <p>Being relevant to many SEOs, there are several common practices believed to improve dwell times:
                            <br>• Optimizing previews for content.<br>• Embedding video.<br>• Writing longer content.
                            <br>• Enabling community features like comments.
                            <br>• Improving page load speeds.<br>• Separating content in sections.<br>• Mobile optimization.

                    <h3>What is Direct traffic?</h3>
                    <div class="insights-data-inner custom-scroll">
                        <p>Also called “direct access,” direct traffic is a term to designate when a user arrives directly on a website, without clicking a link on another site.</p>
                        <p>Direct traffic usually comes from four sources:<br>• Users who know your site’s URL and type it directly in their browser.<br>• Users who have bookmarked your website or saved it as a “
                            <em>favorite</em>.”<br>• Users who arrive via a link shared by another person <em>(in an
                                email, for example).</em><br>• Users who follow a link on an HTTPS page to an HTTP page.
                        </p>
                        <p>Depending on the platform used to analyze this data, sometimes continuing visits – when the referrer page is also on your site – are also considered direct traffic.</p>
                        <p>Direct traffic is regarded as a valuable metric to keep tabs on, as it is often linked to the portion of your audience most loyal to your content. For this reason, direct traffic tends to have notably higher conversion rates, and
                            it is often the object of optimization strategies.</p>

                    <h3>What is a Dynamic URL?</h3>
                    <div class="insights-data-inner custom-scroll">
                        <p>In contrast with static URLs, a dynamic URL results from a search within a website-driven search by a database running on some script. When said site’s database is queried, it generates a dynamic URL. Only the data is changed while
                            the HTML code remains the same.</p>
                        <p>When it comes to optimization, dynamic URLs are mostly seen as subpar compared to static ones, for a number of reasons:</p>
                        <p>• They tend to have lower click-through rates.<br>• Higher chances of cutting off at the end when copy/pasting, increasing chances of 404 errors.<br>• Lower keyword relevance and prominence.
                            <br>• Extremely difficult, if not impossible, to type manually or remember.<br>• Unusable in branding/print campaigns.<br>• Counter-intuitive for users.</p>

                    <h3>What is faceted navigation?</h3>
                    <div class="insights-data-inner custom-scroll">
                        <p>Faceted navigation allows users to narrow down a website’s content according to what they want to find. You can typically see it when you go to an e-commerce or listing site such as Amazon or Yelp. With faceted navigation, you
                            can easily apply filters on different categories to get the results you want to see while browsing through thousands of products or services.</p>
                        <h2>Why is it important for SEO?</h2>
                        <p>Faceted navigation is very useful for visitors when it’s done right. However, it can be a burden when it comes to optimizing a website. Websites with faceted navigation can have a high number of live URLs that shouldn’t be indexed,
                            but end up being picked up by crawlers. Why shouldn’t they be indexed? The large number of pages that sites with faceted navigation have for a single product can compromise crawler’s efficiency. Additionally, the pages can
                            be considered duplicate content and dilute link equity (the authority a link can pass from one page to another).
                        </p>
                        <p>This, in turn, affects the website’s SEO in a negative way.</p>
                        <p>How can this issue be tackled?</p>
                        <p>There are several strategies that SEO experts use to avoid this problem in sites that use faceted navigation. These include:</p>
                        <p>• Using the noindex tag to let bots know they should not include such and such page in the index. While this reduces the amount of duplicate content, it still wastes crawl budget and dilutes link equity.<br>• Using canonical tags
                            leads Google bots to which pages they should index and rank. All similar versions of said pages will be considered duplicates and won’t be accounted for indexing and ranking. This solves the link equity dilution problem, but
                            the crawling budget will still be misused.<br>• Apply a “nofollow” tag to internal links to undesirable facets. This solves the crawl budget issue but doesn’t fix the duplicate content issue, and link equity will get trapped.
                            <br>• Disallowing certain sections of your website using robots.txt is an easy, quick, and reliable fix. You can enter the disallowed customized parameters into your robot.txt file. This has proven to obtain great results but
                            has the disadvantage of disabling the link equity in those sections.</p>
                        <p>Avoiding the issue from the start is the best solution. This can be done if you are building your website from scratch or are in the process of remodeling it. How? By building your faceted navigation in a way that it limits the
                            URL changes. Keep in mind that you need to make sure you have indexable pages for key facet combinations.

                        <p>A featured snippet displayed on top of Google’s first search results page. It’s a summary of the answer to a user’s search. This snippet is taken from a website’s page, and it includes its title and URL.</p>
                        <p>Featured snippets are there to attempt to answer the user’s query instantly, without them having to click on the results links.</p>
                        <p>There are three main types of featured snippets:<br>• Table<br>• List<br>• Paragraph</p>
                        <p>While the first two are self-explanatory, a paragraph snippet is showed as a text, but it can also contain an image as part of the snippet.</p>
                        <p>There are certain types of search queries where featured snippets are more commonly showed: mathematical, DIY processes, financial, searches for requirements, and health-related searches.

                        <p>A study done by Ahrefs

                        <p>Another interesting statistic obtained from Ahrefs’ study is that about 12% of search queries show featured snippets in the results.</p>

                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Google makes that decision. However, there are ways to optimize your content to be a featured snippet, and you can choose not to be considered for the position.</p>
                        <p>To maximize your chances of showing up as a snippet, you should first identify opportunities to be featured. This starts like any other optimization process: keyword research. Also, check for queries where you already rank high
                            and create question-type content for those terms. Finally, you should dedicate a full page to answer a particular question whenever possible.</p>
                        <p>They key is to start creating content that answers user’s search queries.</p>
                        <p>If you don’t want your page to be featured, you can tell Google so by using &lt;meta name=“googlebot“ content=“nosnippet“&gt; into your page’s header.</p>

                    <div class="insights-data-inner custom-scroll">
                        <p>In Google’s previous version of Search Console, you had the fetch and fetch and render tool and a webmaster tool. They are still there, but now it’s called URL inspection, and it has been merged with other tools.</p>
                        <p>What can you do with this tool?</p>
                        <p>Previously, the fetch function sent a robot to scan the URL you typed into the query box. You could fetch their desktop or different mobile versions.</p>
                        <p>This quick and straightforward tool was used you check if there were any network connectivity or security issues with any page of your site so you could address it. When you used the fetch tool, you would only see your page how

                        <p>Using “Fetch and Render” enabled you to see both what the search engine sees and what your visitors see.</p>
                        <p>Both tools displayed the HTTP response, but the Fetch and Render tool also showed your website for your chosen platform. The fetch and render tool request and run all the pages resources, including images and scripts. So, you’d
                            see the difference of how the search engine sees the page you fetch and how users view it.

                            of a URL. You can also request a crawl. Additionally, the tool offers new information such as the URL of the canonical page, whether the page is in Google’s index, and whether there are any noindex or nocrawl blocks. The URL
                            inspection tool also detects resources that can’t be loaded and JavaScript errors.</p>

                    <h3>What is File Compression and Why Is It Important for SEO?</h3>
                    <div class="insights-data-inner custom-scroll">
                        <p>There are a few steps that need to happen before you can see a web page. When you type the URL of the page you want to access or click on the link you found on a search engine, your browser sends a request to the website server.
                            The server finds the page and sends it to the browser, and then the browser downloads the page and shows it on your device’s screen.</p>
                        <p>If the size of your page is too big (images, CCS, JavaScript, and other files add to it) you’ll run into trouble and it will slow down the load process. This is a big problem nowadays because internet users have grown impatient
                            as internet speed has evolved. So, improving how fast your site loads is always good both to improve your site’s SEO performance and your users’ experience.</p>
                        <p>A way to achieve this is file compression. File compression is the process of encoding data using less bits, which reduces file size. Compression can reduce files size by as much as 90%. You can enable compression on your server
                            and send zipped versions of files to the browsers that request your site. This means it will take less time for the browser to show users the page they want to see.</p>
                        <p>There are different formats for compression files, but only Gzip is supported by all browsers.
                        </p>
                        <h2>How does file compression help improve a page’s SEO performance?</h2>
                        <p>One of the most important criteria for a page’s ranking is loading speed. The “lighter” a website is, the faster it will load. Why is this important? As we said before, people don’t want to be waiting for pages to load. They want
                            instant access to whatever information they are looking for. So, how fast Google is able to access your website and its content has a direct effect on SERPs’ rankings.</p>

                        <p>Findability is the quality of a website to be easily discovered by both users and search engines. In a world with more than 1.6 billion sites, ensuring that yours is more easily findable than your competitors’ can make a big difference

                        <p>• External findability, on the other hand, this has to do with how easily your website is found on search engines. External findability is a matter of strategic branding and search engine optimization.

                        <p>The term e-commerce is short for ‘electronic commerce.’ Essentially, it’s any business transaction made on the Internet. E-commerce is about selling or buying items electronically and transferring money or data to execute these
                            transactions. It’s one of the many ways to do business online. Another one is M-commerce or ‘mobile commerce’ where the user needs a smartphone or device in order to make the transaction.
                        </p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>E-commerce has become an everyday commodity now that the Internet has turned into the most powerful marketing tool. Carrying out purchasing transactions via your website now only requires you to have an e-commerce platform to operate.
                            This feature should have all the necessary tools a company needs to buy and sell anything. There are many benefits to using and/or owning an e-commerce site. However, as useful as it may be, it also has its disadvantages.

                        <p>Advantages of online shops over physical stores</p>
                        <p>You can virtually buy whatever you need in one place and without ever leaving your home. Users have the chance to purchase anything from clothes, electronics, household items, groceries, and more. They just browse through a catalog,
                            click ‘add’ and proceed to checkout.</p>
                        <p>Unlike physical shops, which have limited working hours, online stores operate 24/7. This feature makes it possible to buy anything without worrying about time or place.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Electronic commerce allows people who are not located in major urban areas access to goods from retailers who are physically out of their reach.</p>
                        <p>This certainly makes life easier for consumers. From a business standpoint, e-commerce opens new markets and gives business owners the potential to expand their consumer base both nationally and internationally. Another advantage
                            of e-commerce vs. a physical store from a business perspective is the reduction of overall costs.

                        <p>Disadvantages of E-commerce vs. Physical Retailers</p>
                        <p>From the consumers’ perspective, one of the biggest drawbacks of electronic commerce is that users don’t get the chance to evaluate the product personally before making a purchasing decision. Additionally, there’s a delay from
                            the time the consumer makes the purchase to when the product gets delivered, so they lack some of the instant gratification that offline shopping provides.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>From a business perspective, many customers prefer to try the products before buying them, especially when shopping for clothing. Additionally, many buyers are still wary of credit card fraud, and 90% of consumers are more likely
                            to make a purchase when helped by a knowledgeable employee — something virtually impossible when it comes to online retailing.</p>

                        <p>Business to consumer (B2C): when a company or store sells items to consumers. For example, when you buy a sweater through the Target webpage.</p>
                        <p>Business to business (B2B): when the purchasing transaction is carried out between two companies. For example, a software firm sells an antivirus program to another company.</p>
                        <p>Consumer to consumer (C2C): when consumers sell goods to other consumers. For example, someone who sells jewelry on Etsy to other consumers.</p>
                        <p>Consumer to business (C2B): when users sell their product to businesses. For example, a freelance graphic designer that offers its designs to a company.</p>

                    <h3>What is an Editorial Link?</h3>
                    <div class="insights-data-inner custom-scroll">
                        <p>An editorial link is a form of link building. These are links a website earns by posting valuable and original content. The owner of the website doesn’t pay for, or asks for them. These links naturally attracted by sharing useful
                            information on different online platforms, including social media like Instagram, Facebook, or Reddit.</p>
                        <p>Editorial links are known to be more valued than acquired links, which are the ones obtained by the site owner through payment or distribution.</p>
                        <p>Paid advertisement is the most popular acquired link there is. Although these links offer some value to websites, they don’t offer the same benefits as editorial links.</p>
                        <p>However, many marketers in the SEO business keep using acquired links for a few reasons:</p>
                        <p>• They are an easy sell.</p>
                        <p>• The selling proposal outline is very simple.</p>
                        <p>• It attracts clients.</p>
                        <p>• They help agencies with their profits.</p>
                        <p>• They help improve a website’s ranking.</p>
                        <p>Unlike acquired links, which don’t have any merit to them, editorial links are an indication that the website is doing an excellent job at creating high-quality content.</p>
                        <p>Recently, Google began punishing websites that have low-quality or spammy links. So, editorial links are the best “asset” a website can have. A great example is a blogger who has created fantastic content and shared it with their
                            community. Progressively, more and more users will become aware of it, link to their website or share it through social media, adding value to the site and the page linked.</p>
                        <p>Editorial links increase customer loyalty and brand recognition. Search engines such as Google see them as a great example of a website’s authority. One that indicates the site offers high-quality content that is attracting attention.

                    <h3>What is Ego-bait?</h3>
                    <div class="insights-data-inner custom-scroll">
                        <p>When it comes to link building strategies, sometimes one needs to get creative. That’s when ego-bait enters. This type of linking is not so much about SEO techniques, but about human psychology. Ego-baiting is a way to attract
                            high-end links and clients to your website through out-right flattery.</p>
                        <p>How does it work?</p>
                        <p>Well, it’s simple. You appeal to influential people and certified professionals in your niche. When writing a blog post or article, you showcase their strengths and abilities, as well as their accomplishments, products, and/or
                            services. Because, who doesn’t like to be praised? With this type of link building, you encourage them to share your content with their audience and even link to your site, just because they want to tell everyone what people
                            are saying about them. It’s a different approach than merely linking to a page of their site in your content, hoping they pay you in kind.</p>
                        <p>Types of ego-bait content</p>
                        <p>There are different types of ego-bait content and you should choose which to use depending on who you’re targeting. This type of posts need to be personal and intentional, always having your target audience in mind. Some of the
                            more common ego-bait articles include:</p>
                        <p>• Interviews. These serve as great ego-bait because you get a chance to put the spotlight on your interviewee.
                        </p>
                        <p>• Collection of posts. Posts where you gather many experts in your niche (or any other kind of industry) and share their stories and accomplishments with the world.</p>
                        <p>• ‘Best-of.’ As the name suggests, you can create a list of resources, products, or connoisseurs of specific topics as a way of recommending users what to read, buy, or try.
                        </p>
                        <p>• Directories. For a more local approach, indexes can be of great help. For example, if you are in the pet business, listing other pet services in your area can bring tremendous advantages to your website.</p>
                        <p>With a wide range of opportunities, ego-bait is a very creative way to attract the right kind of traffic to your site and potentially obtain authoritative backlinks. And after familiarizing yourself with the types of ego-bait you
                            can create, selecting one that works for you becomes very simple.</p>

                    <div class="insights-data-inner custom-scroll">
                        <p>Email outreach refers to the sending of emails for a specific purpose. It could be for advertisement, business development, promoting a a recently launched product, etc. To promote a business the right way, email outreach must
                            be authentic and personalized.</p>
                        <p>How to accomplish successful email outreach?</p>
                        <p>There are many ways to craft good email content and tools to make the process easier. You can use automated templates or go for a more personal approach. However, there are certain guidelines you should follow if you want to create
                            successful email outreach campaigns.</p>
                        <p>• Get personal. Avoid using only templates, as they often become repetitive and boring. Establish one-to-one communication with your audience to attract more people.</p>
                        <p>• Be sure you are targeting the right audience. Don’t send emails that have nothing to do with what the user does, or their interests. Do your homework, and don’t create content blindly. Browsing through Facebook groups or studying
                            your followers’ interests on Instagram is a great way to start.</p>
                        <p>• Always have a goal in mind when crafting each email. That way you can think of a good strategy to optimize the content you decide to include.</p>
                        <p>• Prove your audience you know them by offering advice in an area that they need help with. But don’t do it aggressively. Do it in a way that shows potential clients you care about them and are willing to help.</p>
                        <p>• Make sure your links are clickable and offer one thing at a time. Avoid bombarding your reader with multiple items, or you’ll likely get rejected.</p>
                        <p>Email outreach is a powerful tool that every businesss should implement nowadays. When you follow these strategies, the conversion rate goes way up, and you increase the chances that your link or product is seen or bought.

                    <div class="insights-data-inner custom-scroll">
                        <p>The primary purpose of Search Engine Optimization is to improve a site’s ranking and increase traffic. These goals are very hard to reach if you only use technical SEO strategies. That’s where engagement comes to play. When defining
                            a brand or business’s content strategy, marketers take into consideration two things: their target audience, and keyword and user intent research. After those two key elements are determined, content is created and optimized
                            for search engines. Said content should be helpful (valuable to users) and engaging.</p>
                        <p>‘User engagement’ shows how much visitors interact with an app, website, or social media profile. It also refers to people who take action either on your website or on your social media pages, instead of skimming the site and then
                            leaving.
                        </p>
                        <p>This metric is an indicator of how valuable your offer is to your audience. This is crucial for SEO and digital marketing, as it tells you is users find your content, or offer valueable and it has been strongly correlated with
                            profitability.

                    <h3>What metrics should be tracked?</h3>
                    <div class="insights-data-inner custom-scroll">
                        <p>Engagement matters to SEO because it allows search engines to find websites that are excelling at eliciting a reaction from their users. This means that what you post sparks the interest of those who reach your site. Depending
                            on your platform or business type, the metrics that you should track can vary. However, there are a few that work in almost any context.</p>
                        <p>• Pageviews. As the name indicates, this metric shows how many times users have seen a webpage on your site. You can measure pageviews using Google Analytics.</p>
                        <p>• Most viewed content. Blog posts or articles that have been seen the most for a given period can be a powerful metric to track.</p>
                        <p>• New vs. returning customers/visitors. It’s good to keep an eye on these figures. They are both a sign of quality content and attractive offers.</p>
                        <p>• Time people spend on your site. This can help you determine if your content is boring or exciting. Also, it is the perfect metric to use for future content planning.</p>
                        <p>• Conversion rate (a visitor taking the desired action once they reach your site). This is also tracked through Google Analytics, and it’s the most important metric to consider. Conversion doesn’t necessarily mean a purchase. It
                            can also refer to a visitor signing up for your newsletter, downloading a guide or e-book, filling out a form, or another desired action.</p>

                <div class="insights-data" data-info="What Are Entities, and Why Are They Important for SEO?">
                    <h3>What Are Entities, and Why Are They Important for SEO?</h3>
                    <div class="insights-data-inner custom-scroll">
                        <p>Entities are possibly the most essential concept to grasp in Search Engine Optimization (SEO). An entity is far more than a noun, object, or place. They cover everything from colors to ideas; it can be a computer, the color black,
                            the laws of thermodynamics, etc. The reason they are so crucial for SEO is that search engines use the connection and relationship between keywords and entities to understand the intention of the search, allowing them to find
                            content more accurately.</p>
                        <p>So, how does Google recognize these entities and ranks them?</p>
                        <p>There are a few factors that the search engine considers when ranking these entities:</p>
                        <p>• Relatedness. When you search for words that are related to each other, Google makes the connection. For example, if you type ‘Leader’ and ‘Radiohead’ you immediately get the result that Thom Yorke is the leader of the band Radiohead.
                        </p>
                        <p>• Notability. Google uses a method that superficially is not very logical. The formula consists of studying how notable the entity is (determined mainly by links, reviews, and relevance), and seeing how low its value is in the
                            category it falls in. The lower the value, the higher the notability. An entity, put simply, is most likely to succeed if it’s highly valuable in a small market instead of being highly valuable in an equally big market.</p>
                        <p>• Contribution. It is determined by external sources and measures how much an entity contributes to its topic. For example, a movie critic writing a review is more valuable than someone who writes reviews for a hobby.</p>
                        <p>• Prizes. As the name suggests, Google uses awards to identify the most valuable entities. For example, prices like the Nobel or Oscar can play a significant role when searching for a specific person.</p>

                <div class="insights-data" data-info="What is Exact-Match Anchor Text?">
                    <h3>What is Exact-Match Anchor Text?</h3>
                    <div class="insights-data-inner custom-scroll">
                        <p>First, anchor text is the text that’s visible and clickable in a link. It is the best way Google has to recognize the relevance of any website. Anchor texts can offer relevant information to both users and search engines about
                            the content of the page.</p>
                        <p>Anchor text is considered an exact match when the keyword used matches the content on the site linked. For example, when you type the keyword ‘SEO strategies’ and it links to a page that talks about SEO strategies.</p>
                        <p>They can increase your site’s rankings significantly, but they can also hurt you. This is mainly because of the 2012 Penguin update Google introduced. This update changed the way link building operates, targeting low-quality links
                            that it deemed ‘spammy.’ It makes link building a little bit more challenging, but not impossible.
                        </p>
                        <p>The solution? Not having 100% of your backlinks with the same anchor text as your website. You need to understand how and when to use it, so Google doesn’t penalize it.</p>
                        <p>However, exact-match is just one type of anchor text. So, to avoid a penalty, you can use different types of anchor texts to diversify your website’s SEO. Other types of achor text include:
                        </p>
                        <p>• Partial-match. This anchor text displays a variation of the keyword. For example, ‘relevant SEO strategies’ linking to a website about SEO strategies.</p>
                        <p>• Branded. These anchor texts use a brand name — for example, Walmart, Target, Amazon, etc.
                        </p>
                        <p>• Naked link. Using a raw URL is also considered a type of anchor text.</p>
                        <p>Images.</p>
                        <p>• Generic. These are basically call-to-actions like: click here, subscribe, contact us, etc.
                        </p>
                    </div>

                <div class="insights-data" data-info="What is Exact-Match Keyword?">
                    <h3>What is Exact-Match Keyword?</h3>
                    <div class="insights-data-inner custom-scroll">
                        <p>In SEO, exact-match keyword happens when the search results coincide precisely with all the keywords a user entered in the search query. This term originated from the Google AdWords (now Google Ads) keyword match types that enable
                            you to promote your ads on a specific-match search.</p>
                        <p>When you run online advertising campaigns, an exact-match keyword allows you to show your ads when a searcher types the exact word or phrase displayed on your ad or bid. Exact-match keywords can be extremely useful and boost your
                            business’s performance quickly and easily.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <h3>What’s the importance of exact match keywords?</h3>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>By using exact match keywords, your target market can find you faster, and you save money on Pay-Per-Clicks (PPC) ads. An exact match keyword will only enter an auction in which the search query is a perfect match or a very close
                            variation of your keyword. There are two other types of matching strategies: broad match and phrase match.
                        </p>
                        <p>If you choose the broad match option, the search engine shows your ads even when queries include misspelled words, synonyms, related searches, and other variants. This can be a problem. How? Let’s say you want your ad to be visible
                            for ‘tennis shoes’, for example. If you choose the broad match option, you could appear for queries like ‘formal shoes’, ‘football shoes’, ‘tennis racquet’, ‘tennis skirt’, etc. That’s why this option can be a waste of money
                            for your PPC campaign.</p>
                        <p>Phrase match can also hurt your business. Choosing this strategy will show your ads for searches that match a specific phrase or a very close variation of it. It can also take into consideration words that are written before or
                            after a query. Using the same ‘tennis shoes’ ad example, with this option your website could show up for search results like ‘discount tennis shoes’, ‘women’s shoes’, ‘men’s tennis shoes’, etc.</p>

                    <div class="insights-data-inner custom-scroll">
                        <p>E-A-T stands for Expertise-Authority-Trust. It’s the metric Google uses in its Search Quality Evaluator Guidelines to judge page quality and provide its users with high-quality search results. These are the guidelines that people
                            who manually review websites on Google use.</p>
                        <p>To fall into the high-quality page category, Google reviews both people and websites. If a person who writes valuable content has a low-quality website (or vice versa), Google won’t consider it a high-quality site.</p>
                        <p>So, what do expertise, authority, and trust look like in the context of both the website’s owner and the site itself?</p>
                        <p>Expertise is very important in both cases. This means that businesses must have credentials. They can be in the form of prizes won in their respective fields, for example. For individuals, this means having credibility in their
                            niche as well as the appropriate certifications.</p>
                        <p>Authority is what measures how well your business or website stand out among other options available. It’s not only about expertly written content but also how valuable your contributions to your field are. How users rate the content,
                            product, or service of a site is crucial for establishing authority before the eyes of Google. For content creators how valuable their content is and which types of websites they usually appear on, and whether they have certifications
                            or not. But sometimes, this metric can be misleading, and one must be aware of fake reviews.
                        </p>
                        <p>To measure trust, Google uses backlinks from other sites. For a website, this translates into validation. Other websites consider your content valuable and original enough for them to link to a page on your site. This is priceless
                            for Google and even more so when other sites with high levels of E-A-T link back to yours.

                    <h3>What are External Links?</h3>
                    <div class="insights-data-inner custom-scroll">
                        <p>External Links are hyperlinks to any domain other than where the link exists. In simpler terms, any website that includes a link to your site in one of their pages is considered as an external link to your website. This works both
                            ways; if you link a site other than your own, this is also an external link.</p>
                        <p>The page where the link exists is called the source while the URL that is linked is called the target.
                        </p>
                        <p>How should you link to external sites? Your anchor text should be a word or phrase that describes what the target page is about. However, you need to use different anchor text to avoid triggering spam detectors. You need to consider
                            the authority of the sites you are linking to since this can influence your reputation.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <h3>Why are external links so important?</h3>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>SEO experts consider that external links are the most critical factor when it comes to ranking. These types of links pass some of their equity to the sites they are in. This means a link to your website from a high-ranking site
                            will pass some of its authority to yours.</p>
                        <p>Additionally, they are an easy way for search engines to evaluate a webpage or website’s popularity. You are probably wondering why not simply measure traffic to assess how popular a site is. The answer is that external links are
                            stable and easy to measure. Unlike traffic numbers, which are stored in private servers, external links are publicly available.</p>
                        <p>They are also a way for search engines to evaluate a site’s relevancy. The anchor text used for these links tends to indicate what kind of content the site has and links usually point to content related to the source page. This
                            provides search engines with relevancy metrics that can help validate the trustworthiness and importance of a webpage.</p>

                <div class="insights-data" data-info="What is a Head Term?">
                    <h3>What is a Head Term?</h3>
                    <div class="insights-data-inner custom-scroll">
                        <p>A head term, also known as ‘head keyword,’ is a common keyword which generates high search volumes. This term is the opposite of long tail keywords, which are 3+ words that are very specific to what is being promoted.</p>
                        <p>Since head keywords generate the most volume, it would be logical to use them for your site, right? Well, it depends. When you are creating your keyword strategy, there are two factors that you must consider. These are competition
                            and search intent.</p>
                        <p>Competition is simple. You must be aware of the competitors you have. Since head keywords lack the specificity of long tail keywords, it could be challenging for you to rank on search engines for those. There are too many competitors
                            placing high bids, and they could bury you in searches.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, we have search intent, which is the purpose of a user’s online search. When someone types a word or phrase on a search bar, he or she is performing a ‘query.’ There are three types of queries: informational,
                            commercial, and navigational.</p>
                        <p>• Informational queries are usually typed in the search bar when a user wants to find information about something specific. For example: ‘Florida’s traffic laws.’</p>
                        <p>• Navigational queries are used when the searcher wants to find a particular website. For example, they’d Google ‘Yelp´ or ‘TripAdvisor.’</p>
                        <p>• Commercial queries are those that are done with the intention to buy a product or hire a service. An example of commercial intent could be a person typing ‘car locksmith near me.’
                        </p>
                        <p>High-volume head terms often lack commercial intent. So, if you want to appeal to an audience where a purchase is the ultimate goal, using these keywords is not very useful.</p>
                        <h3>Why is it important to know the difference?</h3>
                        <p>If you are running a Pay-Per-Click campaign on your website with head keywords, that targets an irrelevant audience, you are losing money. This is why it’s essential to do your keyword research correctly and find the best ones
                            for your site and target audience.</p>

                <div class="insights-data" data-info="What Are Header Tags and How to Use Them?">
                    <h3>What Are Header Tags and How to Use Them?</h3>
                    <div class="insights-data-inner custom-scroll">
                        <p>Header or heading tags are pieces of HTML code used to organize and format the content on your website. They go from H1 to H6 and help identify headers and sub-headers from other types of text.
                        </p>
                        <p>H1 is the most important one as it is the main header of your site. It’s usually more significant than the others and has a sense of prominence. You are not required to use H2 to H6 tags, but they are an easy way to organize and
                            maintain the flow on a webpage’s content.</p>
                        <p>Using these tags can be beneficial to both users and search engines. For consumers, it provides a sense of structure and allows them to know what the site is about without reading whole paragraphs. From the search engine point
                            of view, header tags make it easier for crawlers to scan your site and identify what it’s about, its relevance, and value.</p>
                        <p>How should I use header tags?</p>
                        <p>The main reason for using header tags is to provide order. Give your website an organized feel using headings H1 through H6. The H1 header should be the title of an article, for example. Use headers H2 through H6 to structure useful
                            information such as lists titles, or sub-titles.</p>
                        <p>Break your texts apart using this resource. Who wants to go into a website and see all the information clumped together? By using header tags, the reader can browse through your page more easily. Easy to read websites are most
                            likely to attract more people (and make them stay) than a disorganized site.</p>
                        <p>Even though heading tags don’t affect SEO greatly, Google can still use the keywords included within the tags to determine what results you show up for. Strategically pick them and showcase them on your H1 headers.</p>
                        <p>Lastly, keep your tags interesting to your audience. Use familiar, clear, and concise language to attract more traffic and potential customers.</p>

                <div class="insights-data" data-info="What Is A Headline and Why Is It Important?">
                    <h3>What Is A Headline and Why Is It Important?</h3>
                    <div class="insights-data-inner custom-scroll">
                        <p>A headline or heading is the title of an article or blog post. Your post’s title needs to be thought of carefully. They are the best opportunity for you to grab your reader’s attention.
                        </p>
                        <p>In order to attract as many readers as possible, your headline needs to command attention instantly. They need to pull your audience in. Headings need to be clear instead of clever (but if they can be both, great!). It is better
                            to go with one that is specific and useful than one that appeals to users’ curiosity.</p>
                        <p>Another aspect to keep in mind is your audience’s problems. What specific problems or issues are they facing? What is it that they are searching for the most? By answering these questions, you get a sense of what they need. Headlines
                            should be able to target a specific problem by offering a viable solution.</p>
                        <p>Studies show that using numbers on your headline is a very effective way to catch people’s attention. For example, imagine that you have a headache and want to know how you can treat it at home. By reading a headline that says
                            ‘5 Ways to Treat Headaches At Home Fast,’ you are likely to be drawn to it.</p>
                        <p>You should also let your readers know that what you offer is unique. Use your headlines to show them how original your content is. Be creative and don’t resort to conventional titles. Reading a heading only takes seconds, and if
                            you don’t create one that pops out, readers are going to leave. They are a perfect way to increase your SEO ranking. The more people click and read your articles, the better you will stand against your competitors.</p>

                <div class="insights-data" data-info="What is Hidden Text?">
                    <h3>What is Hidden Text?</h3>
                    <div class="insights-data-inner custom-scroll">
                        <p>Hidden text is essentially text that is not visible to human visitors. However, this text can be detected by crawlers that scan your site.</p>
                        <p>So, can I use hidden text to rank higher on search engines results pages (SERPs)?</p>
                        <p>Although it may be true that putting keywords as hidden text can boost your rankings, search engines nowadays are more sophisticated and able to pick up on these tricks. If crawlers scan the keywords and see that they are unnoticeable,
                            they could get your website penalized.</p>
                        <p>Using hidden keywords to increase a site’s keyword density is also frowned upon and can be considered spamming.</p>
                        <p>When can I use hidden text?</p>
                        <p>While hidden text can impact your website negatively, there are some valid reasons to use it.
                        </p>
                        <p>• When you offer a paid subscription for part of your site’s content.</p>
                        <p>• To improve navigation and user experience.</p>
                        <p>• To improve a site’s responsiveness.</p>
                        <p>Sometimes, SEO experts also use the hidden text command to hide links. Having too many of them on the screen can be overwhelming to the user. So, things like drop-down menus, accordion navigation, slider menus, etc., could be made
                            invisible to the site when browsed from a mobile device, for example. This improves user experience and prevents readers from getting annoyed or frustrated.</p>
                        <p>The features mentioned above could also affect the responsiveness of your website. Responsive sites are the ones who change and adjust to the dimensions of the device used to browse them. The dimensions of a website on a laptop
                            are different than on smartphones. For your pages to be responsive, you must assign a width on the HTML or CSS source code. If you open a webpage and that width limit has been reached, then certain items may appear hidden from
                            your screen.

                <div class="insights-data" data-info="What is the Hilltop Algorithm?">
                    <h3>What is the Hilltop Algorithm?</h3>
                    <div class="insights-data-inner custom-scroll">
                        <p>The Hilltop Algorithm is a search engine algorithm implemented by Google in 2003. It works by identifying and ranking authoritative websites. In order to identify such pages, it worked together with PageRank, another ranking algorithm.
                        </p>
                        <p>But what is an authoritative website?</p>
                        <p>Having authority means becoming a likable expert; one that the audience can relate to and turn to when they want information about a specific subject or topic. To reach this status, the site’s content must combine meaning and fascination.
                            Being considered authoritative means helping your audience solve a problem they care about. But you do it in a relatable way.</p>
                        <p>How does the algorithm work?</p>
                        <p>It’s simple. The Hilltop Algorithm establishes which websites are the experts on their niche first. This gives it a sense of what a high-ranking site should look like. Then, from the links on them, Google starts ranking other sites.
                            With this protocol, the chances of finding high-quality sites increased tremendously.</p>

                    <h3>How did Hilltop affect Search Engine Optimization (SEO)?</h3>
                    <div class="insights-data-inner custom-scroll">
                        <p>The algorithm had a profound effect on SEO too. Having your website linked on major sites like Yahoo, DMOZ, and BOTW increased your visibility. Thus, it was an opportunity for search engines to rank your site higher. Websites had
                            a chance to become more relevant by having their articles or websites featured on many famous and important sites.</p>
                        <p>Even though it is argued that Hilltop is no longer relevant for SEO, it can serve as a foundation from which companies and bloggers can optimize websites. Some ways to do that are by identifying authoritative websites, mixing your
                            site’s link profile, networking, and connecting with real people.</p>

                <div class="insights-data" data-info="What is HITS Algorithm?">
                    <h3>What is HITS Algorithm?</h3>
                    <div class="insights-data-inner custom-scroll">
                        <p>HITS stands for Hyperlink-Induced Topic Search and serves as an algorithm for search engines to rank pages. It was developed by Jon Kleinberg. HITS uses hubs and authority to define relationships between pages. Hubs are highly
                            valued lists for a given query. An authoritative page is one that many hubs link to, and a hub is a page that links to many authorities.</p>
                        <p>How does Hyperlink-Induced Topic Search work?</p>
                        <p>The first step that the algorithm takes is to retrieve the data of the search query. This is the information people type on search engines to obtain a specific result. Then, it performs a computation only regarding these results,
                            without taking into consideration other websites.</p>
                        <p>After that, authoritative and hub values are defined, and a process of iteration begins. In the iteration process, two updates are done: the authority update and the hub update. For HITS, an authoritative website is a site that
                            has valuable content. These types of websites tend to rank higher on the search engine results page because they are considered ‘expert’ pages.</p>
                        <p>Much like PageRank (another algorithm that identifies and ranks sites), HITS takes the linkage of documents on the web into account.</p>
                        <p>However, HITS differentiates itself from PageRank on a few aspects:</p>
                        <p>• It is executed at query time, not at indexing time. The hub and authority scores assigned to a page are query-specific. This means that the ranking will always consider the keyword or content that people are searching for.
                        </p>
                        <p>• Whereas algorithms like PageRank compute one score per document, HITS compute two.</p>
                        <p>• It is processed on a small subset of documents, instead of all documents, like PageRank does.
                        </p>
                        <p>• Search engines do not commonly use it.</p>

                    <div class="insights-data-inner custom-scroll">
                        <p>The main page of a website where users can find information about the business, and that also links to other subpages, is called homepage. In the HTML source code, the homepage receives the name of ‘index.html.’ Sometimes, it can
                            also be called ‘index.htm’ or ‘index.php.’</p>
                        <p>The homepage is where the site’s owner showcases its offer. It provides a detailed description of the business, and it also stores the links to other pages. Sections like ‘About Us,’ ‘Contact Us,’ or even ‘Blog,’ are some of the
                            links usually included in a website’s homepage.</p>
                        <p>The design of your homepage must be fresh and clear. Some information that are usually shown on this page is:</p>
                        <p>• Your contact information</p>
                        <p>• A brief product description with relevant call-to-action</p>
                        <p>• Frequently asked questions (FAQs)</p>
                        <p>Homepage SEO best practices</p>
                        <p>The homepage is the place for you to set up some keywords and lure search engines into ranking your website on the high side. Hence, your content marketing strategy needs to be top-notch.
                        </p>
                        <p>After doing your keyword research and finding out which ones work best for you, you can start placing them on your website. However, putting all your keywords on your site’s main page is not a very good idea and won’t get you to
                            rank any higher. They must be spread throughout the website, so when crawlers scan it, they can find valuable information on different pages.</p>
                        <p>Make sure that your homepage loads fast. Most users won’t stick to a website that takes too long to load. According to Google, a visitor is willing to wait no longer than 5 seconds to see a page’s content! Not optimizing your site’s
                            speed can seriously affect your traffic and ranking.</p>
                        <p>Make sure that your homepage has crawlable content outside of images. This allows bots to scan your website and look for keywords, amongst other things. You should also use semantic markup and include high-quality content.</p>

                    <div class="insights-data-inner custom-scroll">
                        <p>To understand what an hreflang attribute is, one must know the definition of attribute first. All HTML elements can have attributes. They provide additional information about an element and are always specified at the start tag
                            and usually come in name/value pairs like name=’value.’</p>
                        <p>An hreflang attribute is an HTML tag that tells search engines what your target language is. This way, users who are searching in that language can find more accurate results. Other names for it are rel=’alternate’ or hreflang=’x.’</p>
                        <p>Where do I write this tag?</p>
                        <p>The attribute can be applied in one of three ways: on the sitemap, in the HTML &lt;header&gt; of the page, or the HTTP header.</p>
                        <p>Here’s an example. In order to write the attribute on the HTML header section of the page, you must use the rel=’alternate’ or hreflang=’x’ commands. It would look something like this:
                        </p>
                        <p>rel=”alternate”, href=”(URL here)”, hreflang=”x”</p>
                        <p>rel=“alternate” lets search engines know there is an alternative version of a page.</p>
                        <p>href=”(url here)” tells them where that page is located.</p>
                        <p>hreflang=”x” specifies the language of the page and country. “x” would be where the language and the ISO country code goes.</p>
                        <p>You can obtain the different endings of the attribute by consulting the ISO Language and Region Codes, ‘de’ for Germany, ‘es’ for Spain, and so on.</p>
                        <p>This attribute is handy when you want to change your website’s language or want to publish content for a local audience. For example, if your site is in English, but you have created content for a Spanish speaking audience, then
                            adding the hreflang=es to the HTML code should do the trick. This ensures people from Spanish speaking countries can see your content in their desired language.</p>

                    <h3>What is HTML?</h3>
                    <div class="insights-data-inner custom-scroll">
                        <p>HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language and is the base for building websites. Any text, links to other documents, markup language, headings, paragraphs, etc., go inside the HTML code. It gives the website structure and is a
                            powerful tool that is heavily used nowadays. By using HTML, you can publish online documents by creating a website from scratch with headings, text, tables, lists, photos, etc.</p>
                        <p>HTML uses elements and attributes so people can write the source code for their sites. All its features are important, but a few of them stand out from the rest:</p>
                        <p>• &lt;meta&gt; Meta elements are used to specify page description, keywords, author, when the document was last modified, etc.</p>
                        <p>• &lt;head&gt; This represents the Head element or section. This section contains metadata that is not displayed on the site. Information within &lt;head&gt; can include the title of your page, links to fonts, link to the style
                            sheet, and others.</p>
                        <p>• &lt;div&gt; This command divides your content into sections, which you can style later. With this, you can separate the information on your website depending on what you need.</p>
                        <p>• &nbsp;&lt;p&gt; This represents the paragraph command. Whenever you need to write a text that is not a header, this is the one to use.</p>
                        <p>&lt;links&gt; With this command you can link anything to your website. Usually, when you use online tools to search for fonts or background colors, an &lt;link&gt; element is provided.
                        </p>
                        <p>• &lt;body&gt; As the name suggests, this is where you will store the entire content of your webpage. It goes after &lt;head&gt; and inside all the sections and subsections are saved.
                        </p>
                        <p>• &lt;h1&gt; this is the command you need to use whenever you want to showcase a header on your site.

                <div class="insights-data" data-info="What is HTTP?">
                    <h3>What is HTTP?</h3>
                    <div class="insights-data-inner custom-scroll">
                        <p>HTTP or Hypertext Transfer Protocol is the set of rules for transferring files on the World Wide Web. It sends data like text, imagines, sound, video, and other multimedia files. As soon as you open your browser, you are using
                            HTTP.
                        </p>
                        <p>HTTP is considered a stateless protocol because the commands are executed independently, without knowing which ones came before it. Thus, creating websites that react intelligently can be challenging. The Hypertext Transfer Protocol
                            runs on a server-client model.</p>
                        <p>So, what does this mean?</p>
                        <p>The client, in this case, could be a PC or laptop. The HTTP server is a web host that runs web server software. When you click on a website, the browser sends a request to the corresponding server, responding with an HTTP status
                            code. If the URL is deemed valid and actually exists, the connection is granted. Then, the server will send your browser (the ‘client’) the specific site, and you will be able to see all the related files.
                        </p>
                        <p>Have you ever found yourself frustrated by the ‘404 File not found’ error? This is one of the HTTP’s status codes, along with others that you’ll find below. They tell you what went wrong with the process.</p>
                        <p>Some standard HTTP status codes include:</p>
                        <p>• 200 – the request was successful.</p>
                        <p>• 301 – it means that the current website has moved. Usually, the browser redirects you to the new URL.</p>
                        <p>• 401 – you need to log in with a valid ID and password to access the website.</p>
                        <p>• 403 – accessing the site is forbidden.</p>
                        <p>• 500 – there was an internal server error.</p>

                <div class="insights-data" data-info="What is HTTPS?">
                    <h3>What is HTTPS?</h3>
                    <div class="insights-data-inner custom-scroll">
                        <p>HTTPS stands for Hypertext Transport Protocol Secure. It is a variant of HTTP (Hypertext Transport Protocol) that adds a layer of security. HTTPS enables encrypted communication and a secure connection between servers and browsers.
                            The communication protocol is encrypted using Transport Layer Security (TLS).</p>
                        <p>Initially, HTTPS was only used in cases where a secure connection was necessary, such as financial transactions, sensitive company transactions, or emails. But nowadays, browsers use HTTPS instead of HTTP to increase a website’s
                            security, no matter the purpose.</p>
                        <p>HTTPS can withstand malicious attacks and protects browsers from suspicious networks. After a series of conditions are met, the protocol will render a site secure. Thus, adding some sense of protection for the users.</p>
                        <p>Websites need to ‘show’ a valid certificate in order to classify as secure. This certificate needs to be signed by trusted authorities, indicating that the site is secure.</p>
                        <p>If any of these conditions are violated, then the site is viewed as insecure, and access is denied. This allows users to feel safe and not worry about getting viruses or hackers accessing their computers. For people who don’t have
                            antivirus on their devices, this can be especially useful.</p>
                        <p>Advantages of HTTPS over HTTP</p>
                        <p>• It ensures the communication established between server and browser is secure.</p>
                        <p>• It protects users’ data by encrypting the information. Even if hackers find a way to access said data, they won’t be able to read it.</p>
                        <p>• It protects website users’ privacy by hindering hackers’ spying attempts on browser-server communications.
                        </p>
                        <p>• It increases the speed of data transfer when compared to HTTP.</p>
                        <p>In 2018, Google started making non-https sites as ‘not secure.’ This was done to finally ensure that the ‘secure by default’ approach they have been trying to push for years is finally implemented.

                    <h3>What is a Hub Page or Content Hub?</h3>
                    <div class="insights-data-inner custom-scroll">
                        <p>If you want your website to rank higher on the search engine results page (SERP), you need to structure your content and keywords for that to happen. A couple of strategies to achieve that are hub pages and internal linking.
                        </p>
                        <p>So, what are hub pages?</p>
                        <p>They are a central page for specific topics with a set of interlinked, related content that goes back to that page. These can be topics that you regularly cover on your website. They usually contain information that targets high
                            volume keywords and attracts many users.</p>
                        <p>The content you publish on a hub page needs to pertain to your niche. If you own a blog or company about pets, for example, then everything you write about on the hub page must be pet related. It must also be high-quality content
                            that includes relevant keywords for the search engines to index it properly. For those who are familiar with keyword research, try and insert only the best keywords on the hub page.
                        </p>
                        <p>How does a hub page help with SEO?</p>
                        <p>The page tells search engines how your site’s pages relate to one another and make them notice it focuses on a specific subject.</p>
                        <p>Search engines like Google use hub pages to identify how your site’s pages relate to one another. It also helps them notice how the content focuses on a specific subject.</p>
                        <p>An advantage of using hub pages is that it allows you to do well-structured internal linking. You can link to previous articles or blog posts already published on your website. But, you should also create new content to link to
                            your hub page to increase your site’s authority. Linking high-quality content and redirecting users to your website, makes search engines take notice. This will improve your chances of ranking higher on the SERPs.</p>

                <div class="insights-data" data-info="What is a Hyperlink?">
                    <h3>What is a Hyperlink?</h3>
                    <div class="insights-data-inner custom-scroll">
                        <p>Usually referred to as ‘links’ or ‘web links’ a hyperlink is anything that links to another file or object. It can connect two different documents as well as various sections of the same document.
                        </p>
                        <p>I bet you never gave it much thought but, imagine how powerful a hyperlink is. Without hyperlinks, you would have to know every URL of every page on the internet in order to access it. They are a great tool that lets you hop from
                            page to page and from one website to another without having to enter a URLs.</p>
                        <p>For usability purposes, hyperlinks’ color can change. For example, after you click on a website’s link from the search result pages, the link becomes purple. This is to tell you that it has already been clicked. However, when you
                            see a link that you haven’t click on yet, it appears blue.</p>
                        <p>Types of hyperlinks</p>
                        <p>Outbound links – these are the links from your site to another site with a different domain. They should be to high-quality sites and appear natural to users.</p>
                        <p>Inbound links – these are links from other domains to your website. They are the ones that give your site authority as they imply that others trust the information you provide. They should be natural links from relevant sites.
                        </p>
                        <p>Internal links – are the links within your site’s pages. They help distribute PageRank, but more importantly, they guide your visitors through your website and to other content within it that they might find relevant.</p>
                        <p>How can you create hyperlinks?</p>
                        <p>To create hyperlinks, you need to use HTML, which is the Hypertext Markup Language. They are implemented using the &lt;a&gt; (which stands for anchor) and &lt;link&gt; elements. When you use the &lt;a&gt; element, you are referring
                            to a specific link in a certain place of your website. For example, if you are creating an index in your homepage and want to link your ‘About Page,’ then the &lt;a&gt; element is the one you should use.
                        </p>
                        <p>But, if you want to link an external document or reference items such as fonts or a CSS document, then you must use the &lt;link&gt; element.</p>
                        <p>Hyperlinks are a powerful way to increase SEO. By placing links on specific keywords within your website’s content, you can amplify the visibility of a specific page and your website as a whole.

                <div class="insights-data" data-info="What is Off-Page SEO?">
                    <h3>What is Off-Page SEO?</h3>
                    <div class="insights-data-inner custom-scroll">
                        <p>Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is the most vital factor to keep in mind when running a website. A top-notch SEO strategy will make your business attractive in both the eyes of users and search engines. There are three main approaches
                            to SEO that work together so websites rank higher: technical, on-page, and off-page SEO. Off-page SEO refers to actions happening outside your website that influence your rankings on search engine result pages.</p>
                        <p>Also called off-site SEO, this practice encompasses the enhancement of search engine and user insight of a site’s popularity, relevance, trustworthiness, and authority. To accomplish this, a relevant number of reputable websites
                            or people need to link to or promote your site. That way, they’ll be attesting to the world that your site handles quality content.</p>
                        <p>Search algorithms have changed dramatically over the years. And with them, so have ranking factors. SEO professionals are well aware of the fact that an effective off-page SEO campaign is extremely fruitful for a business and its
                            ranking.
                        </p>
                        <h2>What are some off-site SEO techniques?</h2>
                        <p>For off-page SEO, it all comes down to an excellent link building strategy. It’s commonly known that backlinks are the backbone of SEO and with them, your site’s visibility can either go up or down. Search engines use links to
                            determine the quality of your pages when indexing and ranking them.</p>
                        <p>Depending on how your website has earned its links, they can be categorized into three groups.
                        </p>
                        <p>– Natural or editorial links. As the name suggests, your website earns this type of links organically. Website owners don’t resort to any practices of link buying or black hat SEO techniques.
                        </p>
                        <p>– Manually created links. Here, you are deliberating asking for these through link building strategies. For example, when you get customers to link to your site or reach out to influencers to promote your content.</p>
                        <p>– Self-created links. When you add a backlink in an online directory, forum, or blog comment, you are creating your own links. This type of link needs to be treated delicately as the line between them and black hat SEO techniques
                            tend to blur.</p>
                        <h2>What are the benefits of off-page SEO?</h2>
                        <p>Implementing a thought-out link building strategy and other off-page SEO practices can bring many benefits to your website:</p>
                        <p> – It can boost your site’s popularity and authority.</p>
                        <p> – It can increase your website’s ranking. As a result, you will get more traffic.</p>
                        <p> – It exposes your website to more potential customers.</p>
                        <p>For that to happen, you need to make sure all backlinks are from sites whose content is related to yours in some way, and that they are good quality sites. Having a backlink from a low-quality or spammy site can hinder rather than
                            help your off-page SEO efforts. Additionally, the linking sites should have a decent level of authority, as they will pass some of it to yours.</p>
                        <p>But off-page SEO is not only about link building. There are other practices you can implement to make your website stand out among other sites shown on SERPs.</p>
                        <p>Social media marketing is hugely influential these days. Having an active online presence will do wonders for your brand. It allows you to interact with your audience and create a community ready to share your content.</p>
                        <p>For sites or businesses that are well established and have published a fair share of quality content (properly optimized for search engines, and ranking well), guest blogging could be another way to promote their site with off-page
                            SEO. Publishing original pieces on related sites and have them link back to yours can greatly increase your rankings.</p>
                        <p>Taking all these strategies into consideration should boost your site’s visibility and authority among SERPs in no time.</p>

                    <div class="insights-data-inner custom-scroll">
                        <p>When running a website, keeping Search Engine Optimization in mind is vital for succeeding. In today’s world, as competition gets tougher, website owners need to up their game when it comes to optimization to boost their site’s
                            traffic and visibility on SERPs.</p>
                        <p>As opposed to off-page SEO that deals mainly with link building and external features, on-page SEO handles the features within a webpage that make it distinguishable and compelling for users. The primary purpose is to provide benefits
                            to your target audience. Tailoring your website around great user experience is crucial for readers to choose you and your products. When search engines scan your site, on-page SEO plays a significant role. Crawlers look for
                            particular features when ranking and indexing pages. Thus, having a calculated on-page SEO strategy will improve your chances of ranking higher when the keywords you are targeting are searched.
                        </p>
                        <h2>What elements are present in an on-page SEO strategy?</h2>
                        <p>Your site’s content and HTML source code are the two pillars of on-page SEO. By playing with a series of attributes you’ll be enhancing not only your site’s performance but also its spot among rankings.</p>
                        <p> – You can start by adding tags in your site’s HTML. <strong>Tags, or meta tags</strong>, provide search engines information about your pages. Since search engine’s main goal is to provide users with relevant information for any
                            give search query, implementing meta tags helps you appear on relevant searches; thus, they are essential to achieve high rankings. There are three tags that you need to be aware of.
                        </p>
                        <p><strong> – Title tags</strong>. They need to be as accurate as possible since it is what users see when they perform an organic query in any search engine. The title tag informs users, in a nutshell, what the page is about.
                        </p>
                        <p><strong> – Meta descriptions</strong>. It’s the information that appears underneath a site’s URL. A page’s meta description is a brief description of the content on a page, and it usually determines whether a person decides to
                            click on your it or not.</p>

                            interest. Keep in mind that you should only use one H1 on a page.</p>
                        <p><strong> – User intent</strong> is the main factor search engines take into account when looking for results to return for a search query. The content of your pages needs to match what people are searching for and explain your
                            offer as accurately as possible. That’s why you need to publish pieces that are valuable and user-friendly. Keeping your content engaging and persuasive for your target audience will boost your conversion rate enormously. Appeal
                            to their needs and emotions as if you were having a conversation with them. Make use of your target keywords and avoid resorting to black hat SEO techniques that could get your site penalized.
                        </p>
                        <p><strong> – Mobile responsiveness and site speed</strong> are also at the top of factors that search engines take into account when ranking pages. Optimizing these features will make your business stand out among your competitors

                    <h3>What is Opt-In?</h3>
                    <div class="insights-data-inner custom-scroll">
                        <p>Whenever a subscriber or user triggers an application and grants permission for a brand or business to send them emails, we are talking about opt-in. Every time you send newsletters or personalized promotions, you are giving consumers
                            the opportunity to either opt-in or opt-out of them. Almost any website out there has this feature enabled.</p>
                        <p>This practice is most common in email marketing campaigns as it allows websites to gain traffic through subscriptions. You need to keep user consent in mind. After that has been established, you can build a relationship with your
                            readers and push them to convert. When a user converts, it goes from being a bystander to an actual customer. It’s the ultimate goal for any business, and its proper term is user conversion. Also, earning user consent is an
                            indication that people are interested in your offer.</p>
                        <p>The advantages that opt-in brings are more significant than what meets the eye. Besides helping brands stand out in their niche, they offer a voluntary way for users to read your content. It’s a valuable asset in the SEO world
                            as it opens the door for many more possibilities. If you deliver high-quality and relevant content through your newsletters, people are going to be more engaged and inclined to share it. Before you know it, you’ll have a massive
                            community that supports you and is interested in what you have to say.</p>
                        <p>The most common example of an opt-in prompt is a call-to-action (CTA). A button that lets user subscribe or perform a decisive action on your site is a must for your business success. Providing visually attractive, easy-to-fill
                            contact forms on your landing pages can exponentially increase conversion rates (in this case, the number of visitors who provide their contact information).</p>

                <div class="insights-data" data-info="What is Opt-Out?">
                    <h3>What is Opt-Out?</h3>
                    <div class="insights-data-inner custom-scroll">
                        <p>Have you ever found yourself overwhelmed by the many newsletters you are suddenly subscribed to? Well, you’re not alone. Keeping track of every site you sign up to can be challenging. Sometimes, websites fail to stay true to their
                            promise of maintaining the emails periodicity short and sporadic. It makes users frustrated, and in the end, the probabilities of them signing off are high.</p>
                        <p>The process of unsubscribing from a newsletter or other form of mailing list is called opt-out. It’s a very common term used in email marketing, and it can hurt your overall SEO strategy. However, you can offer a way for subscribers
                            to opt out on good terms and provide you insights on their reasons for not wanting to receive your emails anymore. User experience is an essential factor in any SEO campaign, and companies must always offer an opt-out alternative
                            so users can leave whenever they want. That way, you’ll be ensuring that your website is user-friendly and doesn’t take them for granted.</p>
                        <p>The advantages that opt-out offers users is evident — the chance of withdrawing from a mailing list whenever they want just by clicking ‘unsubscribe.’ But how does this process benefit your business and email marketing strategy?
                        </p>
                        <p>Although the opt-out feature is mandatory for website owners, it doesn’t mean that it impacts your site negatively. It gives SEO experts the opportunity to up their game when optimizing a page or even an entire website. If you
                            get insights as to why people choose to unsubscribe, you’ll be able to tweak your campaign to make it more appealing to your target audience.</p>
                        <p>Delivering high-quality and relevant content within your newsletters will keep users interested and engaged. Creativity and innovation are necessary to thrive in today’s world. Also, finding new ways to make your brand stand out
                            will guarantee you a spot at the top of search engine results pages.</p>
                        <p>If you succeed in delivering all of that, the rate in which users opt out of your newsletters or mailing lists will drop significantly.</p>

                    <h3>What is Organic SEO?</h3>
                    <div class="insights-data-inner custom-scroll">
                        <p>In an ideal world, website owners should gain rankings and conversions through SEO. When everything on your site is done by the book, following search engines’ best practices and proper techniques, you are implementing what’s called
                            organic SEO. With it, your site can move up on the SERPs’ ranking positions in a natural way. Also, when done right, it can considerably boost your traffic.</p>
                        <p>Organic Search Engine Optimization fortifies both your site as a whole as well as its pages. This practice makes your content more easily and correctly indexed by search engines, and relevant to what users are searching for. As
                            competition gets tougher and niches start to saturate, you need to implement techniques that make your brand stand out among competitors.</p>
                        <p>There are three types of organic SEO: technical, on-site, and off-site. Each of them brings something different to the table, and implementing them all will make your business succeed in no time.</p>
                        <p>Website owners tend to ignore technical SEO, and this is a huge mistake. Although these features are not visible, they have tremendous power in the background and overlooking them can hurt your site’s performance immensely. Some
                            problems that can be detected and solved with technical SEO are:</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;– URL errors. These often come as bad redirects or broken pages. When this happens, you need to address it fast as it downgrades user experience.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;– Crawl errors. When a search engine’s bot is unable to access a specific page or encounters a problem along the way, your site’s performance starts to suffer. It could lead to poor indexing or categorizing for your pages.
                            Having a well-structured website architecture and a well-developed link building strategy is the key to avoid these problems.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;– Page speed. Search engines consider a page’s load time one of the top factors when it comes to ranking. Optimizing this feature is extremely important for your site’s overall efficiency. Who would want to open a page that
                            takes forever to load? I know I wouldn’t. Investing your resources to improve speed should be a priority.
                        </p>
                        <p>&nbsp;– Responsiveness. As technology advances, search engines tend to get smarter. Making your site mobile-friendly and improving its responsiveness is vital to enhance user experience. Also, now crawlers are taking the mobile
                            version as their priority when indexing and ranking a site.</p>
                        <p>When talking about on-page SEO, we refer to all those actions you perform to optimize your site’s content for both users and search engines. Your website’s pieces need to be original and relevant to increase your chances to rank
                            high on SERPs. Building a firm site architecture and effectively using meta tags can greatly improve your site’s visibility. Additionally, getting rid of thin content is very important for maintaining your page’s authority.</p>
                        <p>Lastly, we have off-page SEO. It refers to all the practices that happen outside your website’s content or source code. They affect your rankings enormously, and it encompasses two aspects. Your link building strategy and your
                            social/online presence. These days, businesses need to have an active online presence. It allows you to build meaningful relationships with your audience.</p>
                        <p>Resorting to organic and natural strategies to build your website up is the best you can do when it comes to SEO. Making sure your website is optimized for search engines will ensure you drive qualified traffic from web searches,
                            enhance user experience on your site, and increase your brand’s authority.</p>

                    <div class="insights-data-inner custom-scroll">
                        <p>Millions of people use search engines every day to find information about practically anything. Whether their purpose is to make a purchase, educate themselves on a specific topic, or for mere entertainment. For website owners,
                            earning a top spot among the first page of search results can be challenging, but not impossible.
                        </p>
                        <p>Getting your business to show up on the first results page is every website owner’s dream. After all, studies have shown that only 10% of searchers go to the second or third page when looking for information.</p>
                        <p>If your site ranks high among the SERPs without the need for paid advertising, we are talking about organic ranking. It’s the result of optimizing your site and its content for search engines. This can bring a wealth of benefits
                            for your business.</p>
                        <h2>How do you improve your organic rank?</h2>
                        <p>The first step you need to take is to determine where your website stands right now. By understanding how you rank against your competitors, you’ll be able to see where you need to improve and start the optimization process with
                            a solid base. Many online tools allow you to check this (SEO auditing tools). And even search engines provide tools for webmasters and site owners to evaluate websites’ performance. You can use these tools to monitor your site’s
                            performance and make the necessary adjustments.</p>
                        <p>After you have gained a sense of awareness on what you are doing right (and wrong), you can proceed to take the required actions. Three elements are considered the backbone of SEO: content, backlinks, and keyword optimization.
                            Mastering all of them will boost your site’s traffic, ranking, and authority among SERPs.
                        </p>
                        <p>High-quality and relevant content is absolutely fundamental to make your website stand out. There are many sites out there that bring little to no value. Search engines take this matter seriously and are always analyzing if your
                            site’s content truly answers search queries and if it does it well. Keep your target audience in mind and tailor your pieces accordingly. Cater to their emotions and needs to boost your conversion rate and enhance user experience.</p>
                        <p>A well-done link building strategy is vital to increase your site’s authority. By linking to pages that are respected among their industry, you’ll be passing some of that authority to yours. Make yourself recognized as an expert
                            within your field, and you’ll drive a considerable amount of traffic to your site in no time.
                        </p>
                        <p>Lastly, target your keywords strategically. Focus on keyword research and choose the terms that best suit your site and your niche, and optimize your site and its content for those keywords. Also, be mindful of your target market
                            and what they want.</p>

                    <div class="insights-data-inner custom-scroll">
                        <p>The term organic search is relatively recent, but since it was first used in 2004, it has become a massively popular expression within the SEO community. It refers to all those search terms that people enter on a search engine’s
                            search bar that yield unpaid search results. The results rendered are based on relevance to users’ search query, links, and domain authority.</p>
                        <p>The best way to make sure you appear at the top of search engine result pages is by implementing natural or organic practices. Although it may take longer to obtain results, once you reach the first page of search results, you
                            just need to stay consistent on your SEO practices to keep your rankings.</p>
                        <p>Crawlers are most interested in finding relevant and high-quality content to be displayed when a search query is made. Making your website easy for crawlers to navigate is key when optimizing your website. Executing keyword optimization

                        <p>When it comes to search results, two types tend to stand out: organic and paid. Organic search results are derived from how relevant websites’ content is to the search query done by a user when compared to all the other content
                            indexed on a search engine. Paid results, on the other hand, are those that search engines show when a business has placed a bid to appear for a given keyword or keywords.</p>
                        <p>If you want to win your audience’s respect and trust, getting your website to rank organically among the search results is a must. This is more appealing to users than a bunch of paid results. If your site appears in the first
                            results page without paying anything, it means that it contains valuable and relevant content that users would want to read.</p>
                        <h2>How can your website appear on the top organic search results?</h2>
                        <p>A Search Engine Optimization (SEO) strategy is crucial when running a website. With it, you can boost your site’s performance and visibility among search engine result pages. Appearing at the top of search results when using organic
                            methods can be daunting at first, but not impossible. Investing your efforts in organic SEO will bring tremendous advantages down the road. You can also hire search engine optimization experts to do the job for you.
                        </p>
                        <p>Here are a few steps that, if done correctly, can help you gain positions on the SERPs ranking:
                        </p>
                        <p>&nbsp;– Identifying your target keywords. Learn which are keywords your target audience is searching when it comes to your business. This way, search engines can easily index your site and show it to the right users. Properly optimizing
                            your site and content for those words will determine if it will be deemed worthy of being among the first page of search results. Get creative and don’t rely solely on Google to do so. Discover new words and phrases in more
                            unusual places like Reddit, Twitter, or Facebook. Also, make use of long-tail keywords. These terms are more specific and tend to have less competition.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;– Making your site visually appealing. Use infographics or small images to convey important and relevant information. If you sell merchandise, add pictures to your product pages. Doing this can increase checkout percentages.
                        </p>
                        <p>&nbsp;– Implementing a prime link building strategy is a guaranteed success for your SEO campaign. Find innovative ways to share your content to the world. Depending on your niche, there are endless opportunities to do so. Getting
                            authoritative websites to link back to yours will increase its visibility exponentially and will help it gain authority as well.</p>

                            doesn’t necessarily mean good traffic, though.</p>
                        <p>Organic traffic, on the other hand, refers to visitors that land on your site as a result of unpaid search results. They reach your pages because you offer content that search engines consider valuable and of good quality. This

                        </p>
                        <h2>How can I increase my website’s organic traffic?</h2>
                        <p>Let’s be real; obtaining a huge chunk of traffic over a short (or long) period can be challenging. That doesn’t mean it’s impossible. Although it takes patience and lots of creativity to make it happen, the outcome is rewarding
                            enough.
                        </p>
                        <p>Setting up a website and hoping for the best is not a sound strategy to drive traffic to your site. Sitting and waiting for something to magically happen is not going to take you anywhere. You need to implement a series of SEO
                            practices to up your game and get the recognition you desperately want.</p>
                        <p>Creating compelling and engaging content is the area where your website should shine. Search engines consider content to be one of the top factors when it comes to rankings. If you fail to deliver valuable information, your target
                            audience won’t pay much attention. So, find creative ways to display useful material that solves people’s problems. Create guides, videos, infographics, etc., that show people how much of an expert you are.
                        </p>
                        <p>When writing content or designing your site, you need to keep your target keywords in mind. Ongoing keyword research will yield those words and phrases that are more relevant for your business. Opt for using long-tail keywords
                            whenever possible. These terms are more specific and have less competition when it comes to ranking. Placing relevant keywords strategically throughout your pages is will ensure crawlers index your content correctly.
                        </p>
                        <p>In today’s world, technology and social media play a huge role. Long are the days when you relied solely on advertisements to get your message across. Now more than ever, brand awareness is fundamental to any business, and social
                            media channels are a great place to make that happen. Appeal to your audience by sharing relevant content and interacting with them through your social media accounts. Use these platforms to your advantage, show your readers
                            that you care and know what you’re doing.</p>
                        <p>Lastly, make your site responsive and mobile-friendly. Google now has a mobile-first policy. This means that mobile versions of websites are their top priority when it comes to ranking and indexing. If your website comes short
                            with any of these two elements, you are doomed to lose rankings or will be unable to gain positions -even if your content is awesome. Why? Because most people nowadays perform searches from mobile devices and search engines

                        <p>Any page that doesn’t have any links to it or which crawlers aren’t able to index is called an Orphan Page. This is a serious problem, and if you find yourself facing it, you need to address it fast.</p>
                        <p>Search engines can find and index your pages properly in two ways. Bots navigate through your site with the help of links. When your website has a well-crafted structure and link-building strategy, it makes the crawlers’ job easier.
                            Bots can also find your site’s pages URL through your XML Sitemap.</p>
                        <p>Orphan pages pose a significant threat to your SEO strategy. Ultimately, these pages are not being indexed, and you’re decreasing your chances of visibility on search engines.</p>
                        <h2>What causes orphan pages?</h2>
                        <p>The two most common issues that cause them are:</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;– When your pages’ variations don’t redirect to the same URL. Ideally, every public page on your site should use either HTTP or HTTPS consistently. It’s better always to use HTTPS as it provides an extra layer of security
                            and it’s favored by Google. Also, inconsistently using www or non-www in your pages can result in orphan pages.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; – When you have misplaced or missing trailing slashes. All of your pages must be written equally and should redirect automatically to the same URL.</p>
                        <h2>How can I find orphan pages?</h2>
                        <p>The first step you need to take is to identify which of your pages can be crawled. This is done with the help of a tool that resembles a bot. Find all the pages that are being indexed, excluding the ones with a noindex tag.
                        </p>
                        <p>After that is done, you need to perform a series of analysis to find the specific pages on your site that are orphan. To do so, you’ll need the help of Google Analytics. Use the tool to locate all your site’s URLs. Try and separate
                            them between crawled pages (the ones obtained with the bot tool) and those obtained from Google Analytics. Export this information to a spreadsheet to make it easier for you to spot any orphan pages.

                    <div class="insights-data-inner custom-scroll">
                        <p>Links are essential for search engines. Having a well-crafted link-building strategy will increase your website’s chances of ranking higher among search results. Crawlers use all types of links to navigate through pages and understand
                            their content. Links within a website’s content helps bots adequately index and rank a website.
                        </p>
                        <p>Any hyperlink on your site that points to a domain different than yours is called an outbound (or external) link. Also, links from other sources that link back to your site are considered outbound. Mainly, they direct visitors
                            from pages on your website to other sites on the internet.</p>
                        <p>External links are considered as third-party votes by search engines. They are highly valuable because they relate to the importance of your site within your niche. By having many websites link to yours, you can slowly (but surely)
                            become a credible and reliable source in the eyes of both users and search engines.</p>
                        <h2>What’s the importance of outbound links?</h2>
                        <p>Having your site rank on the first page of search results means that your business has succeeded in being relevant and valuable for your target audience. When used effectively, outbound links can help you achieve this.</p>
                        <p>The importance of external links comes down to one thing: relevancy. Links to your website from high-quality sites validate your content. Being popular and respected among your community is extremely valuable for search engines.
                            If your peers recognize your content as relevant and of high-quality, your site’s success is nothing but assured. Enough external links will tell search engines that your site is an authority in its niche. Gaining authority
                            is one of the most important aspects in the Search Engine Optimization (SEO). Having an authoritative website is the perfect indication that your business is booming. Similarly, linking to authoritative sites tells crawlers
                            that your content is good by association.</p>
                        <p>So, what do you need to consider when linking to other websites?</p>
                        <p>The implementation of external links needs to be top-notch to take full advantage of their benefits. Here are a few tips for maximizing your link building strategy.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;– Match the relevancy of your content between your site and the target page.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;– Optimize your links’ anchor text, so it reflects exactly what the link is about.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;– Avoid linking to spammy pages or sites that seem suspicious.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;– Only link to sites that are trustworthy and recognized in your niche.</p>

                    <h3>What is Outreach Marketing?</h3>
                    <div class="insights-data-inner custom-scroll">
                        <p>Imagine you just created an original piece of content. You start your day by promoting it on your social media channels. You use features such as videos, infographics, emails, but nothing seems to be paying off. You’re still not
                            driving enough organic traffic to your site. You then start to panic and think that you’ll never be successful. It can happen to anyone. If you work in a very competitive niche, this is a common situation. Outreach marketing
                            can help you overcome this.</p>
                        <p>Outreach marketing aims to get your website recognized by people who can easily reach your target audience. To do this, you need to pitch your content to highly influential people who share the same target audience as yours. This
                            part is crucial: you only want to associate with experts who share your same values and target market. Outreach marketing is also known as influencer marketing.</p>
                        <p>By letting these influencers link to your site or promote your product or services, you’ll be gaining a huge boost in authority. Picture all that brand exposure you could get if a person or organization with hundreds of thousands
                            (sometimes millions) of followers mention your site. It’s a perfect strategy to attract thousands of users in a (somewhat) short period. The length of the process will depend on the people you approach and the type of niche
                            you’re in.</p>
                        <h2>What are the keys of a successful outreach marketing strategy?</h2>
                        <p>As a first step, you would want to jot down the campaign’s objectives and goals. Having clear intentions will determine the success of your outreach marketing campaign. It will also let you decide which type of influencers you
                            want to reach out to.</p>
                        <p>Choosing who you want to pitch your content, product, or service to, is fundamental for the campaign’s success. Mostly, you’d want to find famous people and experts in their industry.
                        </p>
                        <p>Finally, the way you pitch your work is critical. Find creative ways to let them know what you stand for. Email outreach is vital at this stage. Creating compelling and engaging emails, tailored to each influencer you choose to
                            approach is decisive in the success of your outreach marketing campaign. A personalized, thought-out email will better the chances of getting high response rates.</p>

                <div class="insights-data" data-info="What is Over-Optimization?">
                    <h3>What is Over-Optimization?</h3>
                    <div class="insights-data-inner custom-scroll">
                        <p>Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is the key to running a successful website. Almost all website owners these days use these strategies to make the most out of their pages and obtain high rankings on search engine result pages.
                            But, what happens when you get caught up on it and start over-optimizing?</p>
                        <p>As the name suggests, over-optimization is when your SEO efforts get to the point where they hurt the quality of your site. You need to stay clear of overstuffing your website in an effort to rank higher.</p>
                        <p>But how do you know if you’re overdoing it? Here are a few signs that point to over-optimization. If you are doing any (or all) of these, chances are that you’re excessively optimizing your site.
                        </p>
                        <p>&nbsp;– You are using too many keyword-rich anchor texts in your internal links. Having the same keywords in both your anchor text and in your links’ URL doesn’t mean it will rank higher. Relying heavily on this technique can get
                            your site penalized for keyword stuffing.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;– You are targeting non-relevant keywords in your content. At this point, you should know that keywords are the most critical element in any SEO strategy. Including non-relevant keywords in your content is a huge mistake.
                            It won’t allow search engines to correctly index your page.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;– The majority of your internal or external links point to your site’s primary pages. Ideally, you want the ratio of links to your home page and other pages to be balanced. Adding links that lead to pages other than the home
                            page and primary pages within your website is vital.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; – Using a non-branded URL for your site. If you use an URL filled with keywords that don’t resemble your brand’s name, you are dealing with over-optimization.</p>
                        <p>Now that you know what some of the characteristics of an over-optimized site are, you can analyze your content and de-optimize where needed. Deoptimizing your site can take you months, but by doing so, you’ll be ensuring that search
                            engines consider it valuable and relevant to be displayed on the top of the results pages.
                        </p>
                        <p>To avoid over-optimization, keep an eye on the content of your pages. They are one of the most critical features for search engines. Write naturally and engagingly without resorting to keyword stuffing both on the fixed element
                            of your site (i.e., header or footer), and the content itself.</p>

                <div class="insights-data" data-info="What is XML?">
                    <h3>What is XML?</h3>
                    <div class="insights-data-inner custom-scroll">
                        <p>XML stands for Extensible Markup Language, and its primary purpose is to store and transport data. It’s a World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) recommendation that was designed as a flexible, independent, and self-descriptive tool. XML
                            shares some similarities with HMTL as both contain markup symbols that describe pages or a file’s content. However, they were designed for different purposes.</p>
                        <p>At its core, HTML defines a webpage’s content only regarding how it’s displayed. It focuses on how specific data looks in terms of text and graphic images. XML, on the other hand, was created only to carry data. Everything is embedded
                            within the data, and there’s no need to pre-load its structure to store information.</p>
                        <h3>How is an XML document formed?</h3>
                        <p>Similar to HTML, this markup language also uses tags to define its elements. All properties have a beginning and an ending tag. Additionally, an XML document has a ‘root element.’ This is the tag that contains all other items within
                            the file. One benefit of using XML is that it supports hierarchical structures. Web developers are able to create ‘nested’ elements that serve as elements within elements. Two features are used to describe all properties written
                            in an XML file:</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;– These describe the content of the item.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;– It’s responsible for providing the given relationship between elements.</p>
                        <h3>What are the advantages of XML?</h3>
                        <p>The most significant benefit that this language brings comes down to one factor: simplification. XML can facilitate the following actions:</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;– Data sharing</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;– Data transport</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;– Platform changes</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;– Data availability</p>
                        <p>Since XML is an independent language, it’s capable of storing data in plain text format. Thus, expanding or upgrading to new operating systems, applications, or browsers is extremely easy. And the best part? It does everything
                            without ever losing data.</p>

                <div class="insights-data" data-info="What are X-Robots-Tags?">
                    <h3>What are X-Robots-Tags?</h3>
                    <div class="insights-data-inner custom-scroll">
                        <p>Besides relying on content, backlinks, and keywords, website owners must implement different techniques to drive organic traffic to their site and increase conversions. Keeping an eye on your on-page SEO is absolutely fundamental
                            to make your site stand out against your competitors. Search engine optimization is a broad field covering many aspects that help enhance a website’s performance and rankings. One element that plays a significant role in that
                            process is robot meta tags (or directives).</p>
                        <p>Robot meta directives serve as instructions that tell search engines how you want your site to be indexed.
                        </p>
                        <p>Depending on how and where they’re used, they can be classified into two groups:</p>
                        <p><strong>&nbsp;– Robot meta tags </strong>are embedded in your site’s HTML source code and give crawlers firm orders on how to handle your pages. When they are discovered by a search engine, the parameters entered serve as strong
                            suggestions for crawler indexation behavior.</p>
                        <p><strong>&nbsp;– X-robots-tags, </strong>on the other hand, are included as part of the HTTP header of your website. With them, you are able to control your page’s indexing behavior too. The main difference between them and meta
                            robot tags is that they offer more flexibility and functionality. Why? Because x-robots-tags allow web developers to use regular expressions, execute crawl directives on non-HTML files, and apply parameters at a global level.
                        </p>
                        <h3>When can I implement X-Robots-Tags?</h3>
                        <p>Thanks to their versatility, these tags can bring a wealth of benefits for your site’s optimization. Here are some of the most common instances when you may want to employ x-robots-tags.
                        </p>
                        <p>&nbsp;– Whenever you want to control the indexation of content that’s not written in HTML. These include media like flash or videos.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;– When you want to block a specific element within a page. To achieve that, you need to place a noindex tag in an image or link.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;– If for some reason you don’t have access to a page’s HTML or if your site uses a global header, then x-robots-tags allow you to control indexation of that specific page.</p>

                <div class="insights-data" data-info="What is Schema Markup?">
                    <h3>What is Schema Markup?</h3>
                    <div class="insights-data-inner custom-scroll">
                        <p>Schema markup was developed by four top search engines in 2011: Google, Yahoo, Bing, and Yandex, and it can be found on <a href="https://schema.org/">schema.org</a>. They started the collaboration to create a set of microdata designed
                            to enhance the descriptions that appear on search engine result pages (SERPs).</p>
                        <p>But what is microdata? It’s a list of semantic vocabulary tags that when added to your site’s HTML, improves how search engine read it and present it on SERPs</p>
                        <h3>Why is Schema Markup important?</h3>
                        <p>It provides search engines with context. This helps search engines better index a website or webpage and improves the quality of search results shown for a given query.</p>
                        <p>For example, let’s say your site publishes cooking recipes, one of your sections is dedicated to chocolate dishes, and its URL is “yourwebesite.com/chocolate.” Chocolate is a very general term, it can refer to the raw material,
                            but it can also be about any product made with it, or even about the color. You can use Schema.org to tell search engines exactly what is the context of your use of the word chocolate. How? By using a set of predetermined tags
                            on your HTML code.</p>
                        <p>Below is an example of how you would tag a brownies recipe</p>
                        <p>&lt;div itemscope itemtype=”https://schema.org/Recipe”&gt;</p>
                        <p>&lt;span itemprop=”name”&gt; Deliciously Fudgy Brownies&lt;/span&gt;</p>
                        <p>&lt;span itemprop=”author”&gt;Your name&lt;/span&gt;</p>
                        <p>&lt;/div&gt;</p>
                        <p>You can also add micro data about the cooking time and instructions, the ingredients, and even about nutritional value.</p>
                        <p>Do you need to know HTML to use Schema Markup? Not necessarily. Google has developed a <a href="https://www.google.com/webmasters/markup-helper/u/0/">Structured Data Markup
                                Helper</a>, which you can use to generate your code. This tool is easy to use and allows you to create the code for any URL of your website.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <h3>Is Schema important for SEO? Does it help sites rank higher?</h3>
                        <p>There is no hard evidence indicating that using the schema.org markup helps sites improve their rankings. However, rich snippets make webpages stand out on SERPs. In turn, visibility and click-through rate improve.</p>

                    <h3>What is Scraping?</h3>
                    <div class="insights-data-inner custom-scroll">
                        <p>This is also known as web scraping or content scraping. It’s when a site owner or webmaster takes content from created by others and publishes it on their site without having the original creator or owner’s authorization. Content
                            scraping can be done manually (copy-pasting) or using special software.</p>
                        <p>People do this for a few reasons:</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;– They don’t want to take the time to create original content and resort to this to increase their site’s page volume.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;– They think re-posting content from reputable sites will help them improve their SERPs’ rankings.
                        </p>
                        <p>However, this practice does not only infringe copyright laws in many countries; it’s also against Google’s best practices and SEO guidelines.</p>
                        <p>According to Google, “<em>purely </em><a href="https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/2721312?hl=en"><em>scraped
                                    content</em></a><em>, even from high-quality sources, may not provide any added
                                value to
                                your users without additional useful services or content provided by your site</em>.”
                        </p>
                        <p>If you want your site to grow, get qualified traffic, and improve its rankings, you need an original and relevant offer for prospects. In other words, it’s important that you take the time or hire someone to create unique content
                            that is relevant to your audience. This will provide useful results on SERPs for searchers and will keep your visitors engaged and going back to your site once they find it.</p>
                        <h3>How do I identify scraped content?</h3>
                        <p>If you find a website that:</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;– Copies and republishes content from other sites without including original content or providing any added value,</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;– Copies content from other sites and slightly changes it (content spinning), and then republishes it,</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;– Embeds videos, images, or other media without adding any original content or extra value,
                        </p>
                        <p>&nbsp;– Reproduces content feed from other sites but doesn’t offer a unique benefit to visitors,
                        </p>
                        <p>you are viewing/reading scraped content. These are all examples of what search engines frown upon. A website can be penalized for content scraping and drop in the rankings.</p>
                        <h3>What can I do if I discover my site’s content is being scraped?</h3>
                        <p>You have a few choices:</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;– You can contact the website owner directly and asked them to take your content down (a cease-and-desist letter), or</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;– You can file a complaint with google using the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA).
                        </p>
                        <p>Ideally, you should try to resolve the issue directly with the website owner and turn to Google or take other legal actions if you don’t get a positive response.</p>

                    <div class="insights-data-inner custom-scroll">
                        <p>A search engine is a tool and service that allows its users to look for information via the internet. This can be done on PCs, laptops, tablets, smartphones, and other mobile devices.
                        </p>
                        <h3>How do search engines work?</h3>
                        <p>A user types its query, which can consist of one or more words, into the search bar and the search engine returns a list of possible matches that should have the information the searcher intended to find. The list of results is
                            called search engine results page or SERP, and the information can be presented in the form of websites, videos, images, or others. Nowadays, search engines have created technology that allows users to do voice searches as
                            well.
                        </p>
                        <p>Even though when we think of search engines, only a few come to our minds (Google, Yahoo, Bing), there are actually many others available. Some of these&nbsp; include:</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; – Duck Go Go</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; – Yandex</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; – Dogpile</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; Yippi</p>
                        <p>Others</p>
                        <h3>How do search engines decide what results to show?</h3>
                        <p>When a person enters search terms into the search bar, the results shown are listed (ranked) in order of relevance. Every search engine has a different way of going about the ranking process, but they all use algorithms.</p>
                        <p>Simply put, an algorithm is a set of detailed instructions used for completing a task or solving a problem. In the case of search engines, algorithms are the set of step-by-step instructions used to determine which results to show
                            users from the millions of pages crawlers have indexed. Algorithms are updated frequently in an effort to understand how users carry our searches and provide them with the most relevant results every time they search for information.
                            The end goal is to enhance user experience; thus, search engines typically show high-quality, relevant results at the top of SERPs.</p>

                        <p>Search Engine Marketing (SEM) is area of internet marketing that consists of promoting websites through paid listings. It aims to increase a site’s visibility by paying search engines to show it at the top of SERPs.</p>
                        <p>Each search engine has its own advertising platform and tools, but Google Ads is probably the most popular one.</p>
                        <p>SEM tools help marketing professionals optimize and manage search ads. You can carry out keyword research, set a budget, and run advertising campaigns using these tools, and they also help you keep track of how well your campaigns
                            are doing.</p>
                        <p>The goal of any SEM campaign should be to get qualified traffic to your website. It is especially useful to target keywords that you are probably not going to rank for organically (those that are too competitive).</p>

                    <h3>What Is Search Engine Optimization (SEO)?</h3>
                    <div class="insights-data-inner custom-scroll">
                        <p>Search engine optimization is more commonly known by its acronym: SEO. It is the set of strategies and techniques implemented to rank high on search engine result pages (SERPs) and increase website traffic.</p>
                        <p>Even though it is called search ENGINE optimization, the process is both about search engines and people. They are, after all, the ones who will be visiting your site, reading your content, or making a purchase. SEO is about learning
                            what your target audience needs and how they search for it online. It is also about using this knowledge to build and grow your website in a way that lets crawlers know you have the answers your prospects are seeking.</p>
                        <p>Optimizing your site for search engines can not only have a positive effect on the amount of traffic that is driven to your website but also on the quality of said traffic.</p>
                        <h2>Why is SEO important?</h2>
                        <p>The answer is simple: at least 73% of all traffic generates from search engines. And over 90% of people only ever click on the results they find on the first page of results. Yes, you can choose running a Pay-Per-Click campaign,
                            promote your posts on social media, or other online channels. But none is as cost-effective and profitable as showing up on the first page (and top spots) of organic search results. SEO can get you about 20 times more traffic
                            than a PPC campaign. And if you are willing to put the time and effort to learn the ropes, it can cost you next to nothing.</p>
                        <p>What’s more, SEO is probably the only marketing strategy that, once it’s been properly set up, can generate profits in the long run with minimal investment. If you provide content that is valuable for your target market, and you
                            optimized it to reach the first page of search results, you will continue to get traffic as long as it holds its ranking. Paid search will only generate traffic through continuous investment.

                <div class="insights-data" data-info="What Is Search Engine Rank?">
                    <h3>What Is Search Engine Rank?</h3>
                    <div class="insights-data-inner custom-scroll">
                        <p>Search engine rank or search rank refers to what position any website’s page holds on search engine result pages (SERPs) for a given query. Depending on the query, there can be several result pages. Search rank is not only about
                            the position within a SERP but also about which page the site appears on. For example, it is not the same to be on the first position of page one than to be on the first position of page 2. The first spot on the first page
                            gets more than 36% of all the clicks for a search query, while the 10<sup>th</sup> spot gets less than 3%. And that’s only on the first page. Most people don’t even bother to go to the second or third page of search results.
                        </p>
                        <p>Many factors determine the rank of a page. These include the domain’s age and authority, relevance and freshness of the content, whether the site is responsive or not, the quality of the links from and to the site, whether it’s
                            a secured site or not (HTTPS vs. HTTP), and more.</p>
                        <h3>How can I improve my site’s search rank?</h3>
                        <p>According to Google, there are at least 200 ranking factors they use to determine a site’s position on SERPs. Many of these cannot be controlled by the website’s owner, but some can be tweaked using search engine optimization (SEO)
                            strategies and techniques. When done correctly, SEO can improve a site’s search rank.</p>
                        <p>There are four main elements to an effective SEO strategy: technical, off-page and on-page SEO, and relevant content.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; – Technical SEO is about setting up your website so it is easy for crawlers to index it correctly.
                        </p>
                        <p>&nbsp; – Off-page SEO is about building authority for your site through backlinks and social proof.
                        </p>
                        <p>&nbsp; – On-page SEO is about your site’s pages configuration and optimization.</p>
                        <p>Relevant content is about creating content that answers your potential customers’ questions.
                        </p>
                        <p>These are the four key areas that need to be considered when devising an SEO strategy to boost your site’s rankings. If you optimize your website in a structured way and following a thought-out plan, you can start gaining positions
                            on SERPs and reaping the benefits from a well-positioned site.</p>

                </div>
                <div class="insights-data" data-info="What is SERP?">
                    <h3>What is SERP?</h3>
                    <div class="insights-data-inner custom-scroll">
                        <p>SERP stands for search engine result page(s). It is where you find the result of a search query after you entered it on the search bar. The acronym has become a widespread term when talking about SEO, search engine marketing, and
                            web developing topics. It’s typically used for conciseness or when writing the whole term “search engine result page(s)” becomes too repetitive. SEO and SEM professionals tend to use it to refer only to the first page of organic
                            search results. However, technically, it encompasses all search results returned for a given query.
                        </p>
                        <p>Every user’s SERPs are unique. This is true even if you and a friend perform a search for the same query using the same keywords and the same search engine on the same day. How is this possible? Search engines want to present users
                            with the best set of results available. To do this, they take user-specific data so they can tailor the results presented. This produces slight changes every time a result is rendered. So, even if they seem identical and do
                            contain many of the same results, there are always at least subtle differences.</p>
                        <p>Some of the user-specific information search engines take into consideration include:</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; – Type of device</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; – User’s location</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; – User’s search history</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; – User behavior on SERPs (pogo-sticking, click-throughs, etc.)</p>
                        <p>How SERPs look and how they present search results is constantly changing. Google, Bing, Yahoo!, and other search engines are constantly running “experiments” and making small and big changes to provide users with a better experience.
                        </p>
                        <p>That’s how SERP features were born.</p>
                        <p>A SERP feature is any search result on search engine result pages that is not presented like traditional organic results. SERP features include:</p>
                        <p><strong>&nbsp; – Universal Results</strong>: these appear in addition to organic results in the form of images, snippets, videos, etc.</p>
                        <p><strong>&nbsp; – Rich Snippets</strong>: these&nbsp;display additional information on for results listed and can include products ratings, recipes, events, etc.</p>
                        <p><strong>&nbsp; – Knowledge Graphs</strong>: It’s when the information is presented as boxes or panels — for example, the Celebrity Knowledge Panel or Direct Answers from Google.</p>

                    <h3>What Are Search Quality Rater Guidelines?</h3>
                    <div class="insights-data-inner custom-scroll">
                        <p>Google works with more than 10 thousand search quality raters all over the world. They are real people who evaluate search results, rating the quality of pages that show up at the top for given queries. To do their job, they use
                            the search quality rater guidelines.</p>
                        <p>These guidelines tell quality raters in great detail the aspects they should take into account when assessing a page. The guidelines are about 200 pages long and contain information about the type of pages to be examined and how
                            to evaluate them. The document includes the characteristics low and high-quality pages should have, examples of each, and more.</p>
                        <p>The goal of quality raters is to determine whether the results they check meet the needs of searchers. However, they don’t alter Google’s results directly. The data obtained through this process is used to improve how algorithms
                            and indexing work.</p>
                    </div>

                    <h3>What Is a Search Query?</h3>
                    <div class="insights-data-inner custom-scroll">
                        <p>A search query, search term, or simply query, is the word, phrase, or group of words that a user types into a search engine search box. Search queries can be misspelled, in the wrong order, or match a keyword to a tee. They are
                            real terms that real people use to find information, products, services, and more on the internet through organic or paid results. Think of what you typed into the search box that brought you to this page. That was a search
                            query.
                        </p>
                        <p>While a search query and a keyword may overlap, they are not the same thing. A keyword is an inference of what users might type into the search box when looking for a specific product or service. The information used to generate
                            keywords comes from search query data gathered by search engines.</p>
                        <p>SEO professionals use these approximations to optimize websites with the help of tools such as Google Ads keyword planner, Bing keyword research tool, or others.</p>
                        <p>As search engines have evolved to provide users the best results available for their search query, it is no longer only about words or phrases. Search engines have gotten to a point where they manage enough data that they are very
                            successful in determining searcher intent and expectations.</p>
                        <p>For example, if you simply type the word “Italy,” the search engine you normally use is able to offer results bases on your location, on your search history, and other factors inherent to your behavior as an internet user. Your
                            results to that simple search query will differ greatly from mine because our context as users is different. But not only that, search engines also use information that are external to searchers such as trending topics, social
                            networking, and more.</p>
                    </div>

                    <h3>What is Search Visibility?</h3>
                    <div class="insights-data-inner custom-scroll">
                        <p>Managing a website is more than choosing your audience, targeting your keywords, and writing fantastic content. Sure, all of those are fundamental components in any SEO campaign, but your ultimate goal is to drive as much quality
                            traffic as possible. For that, you need to analyze your site’s performance and make the necessary changes when required.</p>
                        <p>Search (or SEO) visibility is a metric that compiles several relevant search factors. These are used to calculate how visible your website is in a search engine’s organic results. It tells you what percentage of all possible organic
                            clicks your site is getting for a given keyword.</p>
                        <p>However, SEO visibility doesn’t show you raw traffic numbers. Instead, it provides insights on your website’s position in the SERPs compared to your competitors. It’s a potent measure that can help you tweak your site’s optimization
                            for search engines.</p>
                        <p>So, how does it work? It follows three simple steps. First, it takes into consideration all your keywords’ rankings. Then, it determines an estimated click-through-rate (CTR) based on those ranking positions. Lastly, it gathers
                            all your CTRs and divides them by the total number of keywords. The result is a percentage ranging from 0% to 100%.</p>
                        <p><strong>What do these percentages mean?</strong></p>
                        <p>0% search visibility- your website is not on the first page of search results.</p>
                        <p>33%-35% search visibility – your site ranks number one for a given keyword.</p>
                        <p>100% search visibility – your site has all the traffic for the organic ranking on Google for a given keyword (this is highly unlikely).</p>
                        <h2>Why is SEO Visibility important?</h2>
                        <p>Understanding how this metric works and using it to overhaul your SEO efforts is crucial to keep your site fresh and up to date.</p>
                        <p>Sometimes, when an algorithm update is introduced, your website may experience some performance problems. It could be due to incompatibility, or that a search engine has found something worthy of penalizing your site. With search
                            visibility, you can quickly diagnose this problem.</p>
                        <p>However, the biggest benefit that SEO visibility offers your website is the ability to compare your keywords in terms of percentages instead of absolutes. This can help you easily see the difference in how well each of the keywords
                            you are ranking for is performing. For example, the traffic two keywords generate might not be strikingly different. However, if you notice that one keyword already ranks high and has a high search visibility percentage (i.e.,
                            33% or more), this means that keyword is performing at its highest. If the second keyword shows somewhat similar traffic, but a low search visibility percentage, you should focus your optimization efforts on this one. This
                            gives you an upper hand when fine-tuning your keyword optimization strategy. By taking the full advantages of this metric, you can end up with a high-ranking keyword that you probably weren’t even paying that much attention
                            to.

                    <h3>What is Search Volume?</h3>
                    <div class="insights-data-inner custom-scroll">
                        <p>Website owners spend the majority of their time and efforts implementing strategies to drive traffic to their sites. One of the main factors to consider when doing this is keywords. They are the backbone of SEO and, when used wisely,
                            your website has higher chances of ranking at the top of SERPs.</p>
                        <p>Search volume is the average number of user queries generated for a given keyword within a specific time frame, usually searches per month. A high search volume means that topic, product, or service is of high interest to users.</p>
                        <p>Knowing how many searches a specific keyword is generating, is crucial when optimizing your site. Why? If you use keywords that no one is looking for, all your efforts will be pointless. If, on the contrary, you use keywords with
                            high search volume, then you need to look into other factors to ensure you focus on the right ones to position your site.</p>
                        <p>Search volume is an essential metric for your SEO campaign. It shows you the relevance of specific keywords and allows you to evaluate the potential traffic they could generate. This is vital not only for your site’s optimization
                            but also if you are running a PPC campaign.</p>
                        <p>Keywords with a high search volume often imply more traffic, but also, greater competition. The greater the competition, the more effort you need to make to rank high for these keywords. Low search volume indicates lower competition,
                            as well as traffic.</p>
                        <p>Here are some of the advantages and disadvantages of high and low search volume keywords for PPC campaigns:
                        </p>
                        <p>High search volume keywords advantages:</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; – More people are likely to see your ad.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; – More people are likely to click on your ad.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; – You are more likely to increase sales.</p>
                        <p>High search volume keywords disadvantages:</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; – Higher per click costs. More clicks, higher costs.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; – Less qualified leads.</p>
                        <p>Low search volume keywords advantages:</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; – Lower costs per click. Fewer clicks, lower costs.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; – More qualified leads.</p>
                        <p>Low search volume keywords disadvantages:</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; – Fewer ad views.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; -Fewer people are likely to click on your ad.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; – Fewer people are likely to buy your product or service.</p>
                        <p>Some search volume values are seasonal, while others don’t vary much in relation to the time of the year. For example, it’s unlikely that many people look for “cheap Christmas trees” in July. On the other hand, “women’s shoes on
                            sale” might have a more constant search volume throughout the year.</p>
                        <h2>How can I choose the right keywords?</h2>
                        <p>Search volume makes the keyword decision process somewhat easier. But, how can you choose between high or low search volume? Each of them brings something different to the table and, ultimately, a balance between the two is recommended.
                        </p>
                        <p>In any SEO campaign, a balance between head and long-tail keywords must exist. The first one refers to those that are more general and have more considerable competition. Thus, they have a high search volume. On the other hand,
                            long-tail keywords are much more specific, and the competition involving them is not that big. Integrating both of them on your site is the best way to increase its visibility and authority on SERPs.</p>

                    <h3>What are Seasonal Trends?</h3>
                    <div class="insights-data-inner custom-scroll">
                        <p>Do you love seasons? Do you immediately get excited whenever Summer or Winter is around the corner? What about Christmas or Halloween? Just like you look forward to all those holidays every year, so do SEO experts. Specific events
                            that happen throughout the year are an excellent opportunity for website owners to up their game. Coming up with an attractive offer and a well-planned marketing strategy can successfully boost sales.</p>
                        <p>Seasonal Trends are those spikes in sales of certain products for a specific, predictable time of the year. There is an SEO marketing sub-niche that handles optimization for these occasions. It’s called Seasonal SEO. These trends
                            are used to drive conversions based on themes and a finite period. There are two types of seasonal SEO strategies:</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; – Time-based. These encompass the seasons themselves or any other monthly trends.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; – Event-based. These refer to specific occasions such as Christmas, Thanksgiving, Saint Patrick’s Day, Halloween, etc.</p>
                        <p>Focusing on user intent is the primary factor you need to consider when implementing a seasonal SEO strategy. Studying user trends and customizing your content to meet your target audience’s needs can vastly improve your site’s
                            conversion rate and visibility. Here are some other benefits that this type of strategy provides:
                        </p>
                        <p>&nbsp; – Your customers’ needs are relatively easy to foresee and meet.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; – It provides information that can be used for increasing upsells and cross-selling yearly.
                        </p>
                        <p>A seasonal SEO campaign doesn’t happen overnight, though. A lot of hard work and time is put into delivering a top-notch strategy. There’s content creation, marketing, optimization, and publishing involved when designing a seasonal
                            campaign. That’s why it’s best to study the upcoming trends and start planning around them.
                        </p>
                        <p>You need to be clear on what the goals of the campaign are before launching. Who do you want to target? What type of product do you want to offer? What message do you want to send? Additionally, you have to start targeting keywords
                            that match your specific offer. Then, you need to create appropriate content to target user intent.
                        </p>
                        <p>If you want to implement this type of strategy, you should keep in mind a few things well ahead of time:</p>
                        <p>Examine previous data. How has that specific season or event done in the past? What have users searched the most during that time of the year/event? Knowing this will give you insights about your own campaign and unveil opportunities
                            to optimize it.</p>
                        <p>Create a content calendar. Once you have the necessary information about the most popular trends that happen every year, you can design a plan for your future campaigns. That way, you’ll be speeding up and smoothing the process
                            when it’s time to launch your offers.</p>
                        <p>A seasonal SEO campaign can drive a lot of sales for a business, but it needs to be thought-out well before the target season starts.</p>

                <div class="insights-data" data-info="What are Secondary Keywords?">
                    <h3>What are Secondary Keywords?</h3>
                    <div class="insights-data-inner custom-scroll">
                        <p>Every SEO strategy begins with keyword research: the process of choosing those particular terms you want to rank for. They are called primary keywords and will determine the type of content you write.</p>
                        <p>Keyword research is probably the most important step in any SEO strategy. The words and phrases you target will determine your site’s success and its overall SERP ranking. Matching them to specific user intent and your target audience’s
                            needs is one of the keys to a successful SEO strategy.</p>
                        <p>However, that isn’t all there is to guarantee your website’s visibility. The quality of your content and your SEO efforts can be enhanced by choosing a set of related terms that directly support your primary keywords.</p>
                        <p>Those extra words and phrases you select are called secondary keywords. Secondary keywords should be closely related to your primary ones and fit within your content naturally. You should look for those semantically-related phrases
                            that searchers tend to use interchangeably.</p>
                        <h2>What advantages do secondary keywords bring?</h2>
                        <p>Although these terms are not strictly necessary for your SEO campaign, using them can boost your site performance and make you stand out among your competitors.</p>
                        <p>Search engines are always finding new ways to deliver the best sets of results based on user intent. Ultimately, they want the content to be high-quality and relevant to a user’s query. Adding a few secondary keywords to your site
                            could boost your visibility on SERPs as they allow search engines to understand your page’s context better.</p>
                        <p>Consequently, your chances of ranking higher on SERPs could increase. Understanding how search engines algorithms work and playing to their advantage can place your site among the top of the search results.</p>
                        <p>However, no amount of secondary keywords will benefit your website if you still write low-quality content. Search engines may be able to identify and index your content better, but it still needs to be high-quality and relevant
                            to your target audience. Focusing on consistently providing it will guarantee the success of your SEO strategy.</p>

                <div class="insights-data" data-info="What are Seed Keywords?">
                    <h3>What are Seed Keywords?</h3>
                    <div class="insights-data-inner custom-scroll">
                        <p>When deciding to optimize your website, so it ranks better on search engines, you are presented with the daunting task that is keyword research. Choosing the right set of terms you want to target within your site can be exhausting.
                            The number of terms available can be overwhelming for some niches, and there are many factors to consider when deciding on the few that will make your site stand out. Targeting the right ones will be crucial for your site’s
                            rankings.
                        </p>
                        <p>The first step of keyword research is to identify your seed keywords. Also known as primary keywords, these are the foundation of the whole process and the backbone of SEO. They typically consist of one or two words and are fundamental
                            to understand the context of your niche. For example, if you specialize in the weight loss, you seed keywords should look like ‘diet,’ ‘fitness,’ ‘lifestyle,’ etc.</p>
                        <p>Choosing your primary keywords will pave the way to identifying your long-tail keywords. Each seed keyword can generate 50 or more long-tail keywords. These are more specific to your site’s content and offer less competition when
                            it comes to search volume.</p>
                        <h2>Why are seed keywords important?</h2>
                        <p>Deciding a content marketing strategy can be a challenging task. It’s much more than picking a topic and start writing about it. You need to consider your competitors within that industry, what they offer, and how you can match
                            and exceed that offer providing content that’s fresh and original.</p>
                        <p>Carefully and thoughtfully choosing your target keywords is paramount in your SEO and content marketing campaigns. Compiling a list of extensive seed keywords is the first step you need to take to make that happen. They are the
                            stepping stones to successfully ranking your site.</p>
                        <p>However, it’s not about envisioning what you want your website to look like among a specific niche. It’s about learning about your competitors’ keywords and how they are using them. Think of it is as drawing a map of an area you
                            are not very familiar with but are getting ready to explore. Seed keywords will paint the picture for you and help you understand your niche thoroughly.</p>

                <div class="insights-data" data-info="What is Sentiment Analysis?">
                    <h3>What is Sentiment Analysis?</h3>
                    <div class="insights-data-inner custom-scroll">
                        <p>Sentiment Analysis is the process of identifying and categorizing opinions expressed in a piece of text using calculations. This is done by specialized software. Sentiment analysis helps determine whether the writer’s attitude
                            towards a particular topic or product is positive, negative, or neutral.</p>
                        <p>Search engines are always looking for ways to improve the results they show to users through algorithm updates and by improving their ranking and indexing process. For them, understanding searcher intent is fundamental.</p>
                        <p>Over the years, a series of technological advances in AI and machine learning have made this possible, and sentiment analysis has played a key role. Now, search engines use it to better understand what a person is looking for to
                            provide the most relevant yet balanced results.</p>
                        <p>In 2008, Google introduced what we now know as featured snippets. These are selected search results that are included on top of Google’s SERPs, before organic results. Their primary purpose is to answer users’ questions right away.
                            A site that’s displayed among these results gets additional brand exposure and visibility among SERPs.
                        </p>
                        <p>Bing announced in 2018 that it is incorporating sentiment analysis to the process of retrieving intelligent snippets on the search results pages. However, they take into consideration a few other factors in the process:</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; – The given authority and quality of a website.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; – How relevant the content for a given topic is.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; – Whether the content is easy to crawl and index.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; – If the webpage offers a good user experience.</p>
                        <h2>How could sentiment analysis affect SEO?</h2>
                        <p>It could be particularly helpful for local SEO. Search engines may gain a better understanding of whether a business’s review is positive or negative, or even if a webpage is linked in a negative way. Then, use this information
                            to index and rank said page or business.</p>
                        <p>As for how can SEO professionals use the information? By analyzing the results returned for a given query, search engines may offer clues about what users are looking for. Additionally, sentiment analysis can play a significant
                            role in:
                        </p>
                        <p>The new update will set the stage for future algorithms. With it, search results are getting more and more accurate every day. Users will be able to find whatever they are looking</p>

                        <p>Every website owner out there should be aware of the term Search Engine Optimization (SEO). It refers to a set of strategies implemented by business owners or digital marketers to increase a site’s ranking and visibility on SERPs.
                        </p>
                        <p>Unless you are an SEO expert yourself, you’ll need to hire a professional or a company that provides SEO services. They can steer you towards your ultimate goal: a successful and authoritative website ranking among the top results.

                        <p>But what do SEO services entail? SEO professionals implement a set of steps and strategies to increase your site’s traffic and rankings. Here are some of the services that an SEO agency may provide to optimize your website:
                        </p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; Keyword research</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; Competition analysis</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; SEO site audits</p>

                        <p>All of these features are crucial when optimizing a website for search engines. Each of them brings something different to the table and including them in your site’s architecture, and content is vital for its success.</p>
                        <p>SEO companies have the challenging task of optimizing your website while keeping up with a search engine’s update. They need to know the guidelines like the back of their hand to avoid any penalty on your site. SEO services are
                            as diverse as websites themselves. Some of the more sought-after SEO services include local SEO, e-commerce SEO, technical SEO, and more.</p>
                        <h2>How do I choose the right SEO service?</h2>
                        <p>Choosing the right SEO agency is fundamental for your site’s success; not to mention for your pocket. There are a few factors that every company should offer to ensure that your website is fully optimized:</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; – An SEO site audit. This is essential to get a sense of how your site’s overall strategy and performance are doing. Studying the behavior of some of your site’s elements can provide insights into what you are doing right
                            or wrong.
                        </p>
                        <p>&nbsp; – Competitors analysis. You must not only know how your own website is doing but also how your competitors are ranking among search engines. Taking their strategies into consideration and optimizing for your target audience
                            to fill in the gaps they’re missing could boost your site’s rankings in no time.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; – Off-site or off-page SEO. This is the aspect responsible for promoting your website through link building strategies and social media management. Adding backlinks to your site is essential as search engines use it as one
                            of the primary factors when it comes to ranking. Creating shareable content in your blog and keeping an active social media presence are the best ways to achieve a successful off-site SEO.

                        </p>
                        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; – Creating an XML Sitemap and submitting it to search engines.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; – Creating high-quality title tags, meta descriptions, and header tags.
                        </p>
                        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; – Implementing a well-played keyword research and optimization strategy.
                        </p>
                        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; – Assuring that your site is responsive, mobile-friendly, and fast.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; – Inserting relevant and quality images throughout your pages.</p>

                    <h3>What is an SEO Site Audit?</h3>
                    <div class="insights-data-inner custom-scroll">
                        <p>Nowadays, your site success is heavily tied to your SEO efforts. Virtually every website owner out there should perform Search Engine Optimization tactics to increase their rankings and popularity among the SERPs. Thus, relying
                            on organic methods to improve your site’s performance is a must.</p>
                        <p>Whenever you want to know how your website is doing, efficiency-wise, you must perform an SEO audit. With it, you can analyze which features of your campaign are being fruitful and which aren’t. It’s an essential task you must
                            implement now and then.</p>
                        <p>However, ranking factors have changed tremendously throughout the years, and those metrics that were relevant in the past may not be today. Besides optimizing keywords, backlinks, and content, there are many other elements you
                            must keep in mind. Responsive and mobile-friendly sites are precious in today’s world. Search engines are now considering mobile versions as its top priority when it comes to ranking and indexing.
                        </p>
                        <h2>What should I check when performing an SEO Site Audit?</h2>
                        <p>Even for the most professional business owners, implementing an SEO audit can be daunting. There are many things you need to check to optimize your site at its fullest. However, it doesn’t mean that’s impossible.</p>
                        <p>Here are some of the most important factors to keep an eye on.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;– The technical aspect of your SEO, which includes hosting and indexing.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;–&nbsp; On-site SEO metrics such as content, keywords, and metadata.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;–&nbsp; Link building strategies and external references.</p>
                        <p>To understand how the technical aspects of your site are doing, you need to identify what crawlers see when scanning your pages. You can check this by crawling your website to detect potential problems.</p>
                        <p>Common problems you can find when crawling your site:</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; -An unintended noindex tag around your code. Adding this tag will stop search engines from indexing a page.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; – 404 or 500 errors. The first one happens when you have one of your pages set up to rank to a specific term, but due to some other circumstances, the page doesn’t exist anymore. 500 errors usually refer to server problems.
                        </p>
                        <p>&nbsp; – Not having a structured website. Make sure that your site’s architecture is well organized and avoid creating deep ends. Make your pages easy for crawlers to navigate through, as this will determine your rankings among
                            the SERPs.
                        </p>
                        <p>On-site SEO-related problems:</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; Lack of metadata. Such is the case of title tags and meta descriptions. Titles should match the content on a page and be representative of your brand’s name. Likewise, a well-crafted meta description can determine
                            your site’s conversion rate. Providing a short but clear explanation of your pages in the SERPs can drive more traffic to your site.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; Thin content. This type of content has little or no value at all, and it’s a big no-no if you want your site to rank high. Creating compelling and valuable content is the backbone of your SEO strategy. You need to
                            be clear on who your target audience is and what they need. Appealing to their emotions and desires will boost your site’s visibility and popularity among SERPs. Keep the content original, relevant, and updated so crawlers
                            can recognize its worth.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; Not having a strategy behind the keywords you target. Without this, you might as well shut down you’re your site. Keyword research and optimization strategy are one of the first steps of on-page SEO. Find words and
                            phrases relevant to your niche and place them strategically among your pages. When possible, use unusual or unpopular terms to increase their popularity. You’ll likely have higher chances of ranking for them among SERPs.</p>
                        <p>Off-site SEO-related problems:</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; Having little or no internal and external links. Backlinks are essential for SEO. They are the way search engines can: 1. Understand better what your site is about, and 2. Determine your site’s authority. Make sure
                            your internal links are structured and balanced and that your external links come from reputable sources.

                    <h3>What is an SEO URL?</h3>
                    <div class="insights-data-inner custom-scroll">
                        <p>Originally designed to replace IP Addresses, URLs are text stings (and sometimes numbers) that serve as a way for computers to communicate with servers. They also are able to identify a site’s file structure. URL stands for Uniform
                            Resource Locator. A URL is comprised of three elements: a protocol, a domain name, and a path.
                        </p>
                        <p>Now that you know what a URL is, you may be wondering what does it have to do with SEO? Well, there are ways a well-crafted URL can improve your Search Engine Optimization (SEO) efforts.
                        </p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; They can improve user experience (UX). With URLs, both users and search engines can easily understand what the destination page is all about. This allows readers to decide whether that specific page is relevant to
                            them or not.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; They provide opportunities to use keywords. Although a site’s URL doesn’t play a significant role when it comes to ranking, placing specifics keyword in them could. Search engines use URLs to identify relevancy when
                            it comes to users’ queries.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; Your link building strategy can benefit from a well-written URL, as they can serve as their own anchor text. This will also provide crawlers a sense of what a page is about when they are scanning your site.
                        </p>
                        <h2>What are the best SEO practices for URLs?</h2>
                        <p>Focusing on your site’s URL could seem like a trivial task. Nevertheless, if you want your website to succeed in today’s world, you can’t take anything for granted when it comes to SEO.
                        </p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; Keep your URLs concise and straightforward. They need to be as accurate as possible so users and search engines can understand them. Make them relevant and defining of the content of a page.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; If necessary, use hyphens to separate words. This will increase its readability. Avoid using underscores, spaces, or any other different character that may compromise its purpose.
                        </p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; Similarly, abstain from using uppercase letters. Try to use lowercase letters to avoid problems with duplicate content.</p>

                <div class="insights-data" data-info="What is Share of Voice?">
                    <h3>What is Share of Voice?</h3>
                    <div class="insights-data-inner custom-scroll">
                        <p>It’s only logical to think that all marketers out there want their campaign to succeed. Running an efficient marketing and PR campaign can boost your site’s rankings and authority on SERPs.
                        </p>
                        <p>So, how can you measure that success? One way to do so is by calculating your brand’s Share of Voice. This refers to the number of times it is mentioned in relevant conversations. It’s a great way to measure your brand’s visibility
                            in diverse advertising/publishing channels, how much you dominate the market, and how it compares against your competitors.</p>
                        <p>With all the recent updates from search engines, calculating this data is easier than before. People rely on it to optimize their websites and make sure they stand out among the crowd.
                        </p>
                        <p>While this metric is mostly used to explain a brand’s paid advertising market share, it can also include other elements of advertising and digital marketing such as social media mentions or keyword-specific traffic.</p>
                        <p>If you want to know your brand’s share of paid advertising, you can calculate Share of Voice with the following formula:</p>
                        <p>Share of Voice (SOV) = Brand/Product Advertising / Total Market Advertising</p>
                        <p>Usually, you would estimate this by considering impressions. They are counted every time your ad is shown on a search engine results page.</p>
                        <p>A more general formula could be:</p>
                        <p>Your brand’s metric / Total market metric x 100</p>
                        <p>You could use branded hashtags for social media measurement. For example, let’s say your hashtag is used or shows up 50 times, while the total of branded hashtags in your niche is 100. This means your SOV for social media in your
                            market is 50%. Other metrics you can use to calculate Share of Voice include:</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; Organic keywords</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; Pay per click (PPC) keywords</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; Revenue</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; Mentions</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; – Others</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>A big part of your Search Engine Optimization (SEO) efforts should go towards competitor analysis. Here, you identify what other websites within your niche are doing right (and wrong) and what gaps there are in their content. By
                            gathering this information, you get a sense of what you can optimize on your own website and fill in the areas that they are not exploiting. SOV is a great metric to do this.</p>
                        <p>Performing this process all by yourself can be daunting and challenging. Manually calculating SOV can take too much of your time, and let’s be honest; time is money. That’s why there are some SEO toolsets out there you can use
                            to do it instead. These include Sycara and Brightedge. They have a built-in Share of Voice analysis tool to make your work easier.</p>
                        <p>When calculating SOV, you consider the total amount of impressions, links, and/or rankings. A useful measurement should also track actions throughout all channels. These include:</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; Hyperlinks that are generating traffic to your site.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; – Time spent by users on a page after a specific link.</p>

                <div class="insights-data" data-info="What are Sitelinks?">
                    <h3>What are Sitelinks?</h3>
                    <div class="insights-data-inner custom-scroll">
                        <p>Every time someone uses a search engine to find information, they directed to a page that displays a series of results. These are called search snippets and consist mainly of four parts.
                        </p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; Title</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; URL</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; Description</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; Sitelinks</p>
                        <p>Snippets offer a brief description of a page’s name, its location, and the type of content that they handle. For SEO purposes, titles, URLs, and meta descriptions can be optimized with on-page strategies. Improving them allows
                            a website to appear at the top of the SERPs.</p>
                        <p>Another feature that appears in a search snippet is called sitelink. Sitelinks are shown below the description of a page and are automated by search engines. Let’s take Google as an example. The search engine’s algorithm points
                            to additional pages that it thinks are relevant to a user query. This means that you can’t manually add them to a page’s snippet.</p>
                        <p>So, if you don’t have a direct influence over sitelinks, why should you pay attention to them? Well, even though you have no power over them, they can do wonders for a site’s performance.
                        </p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; They are a way to increment a page’s click-through-rate (CTR). This refers to the number of times people are clicking and choosing a site. As a result, your site’s rankings and visibility could increase.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; When sitelinks are shown, users can click a site’s inner pages directly, without having to visit your homepage. This improves user experience and drives traffic to those pages, which are equally crucial for your
                            business.
                        </p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; If Google has decided to show sitelinks for your website, then it means that it trusts you. Search engines don’t go around displaying sitelinks for everyone. So, if it happens for you, it’s a sign that you are doing
                            something right.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; Using sitelinks can help you boost brand awareness. If users see a lot of pages listed underneath your site’s URL, they can learn more about your brand and what you have to offer. There is a good chance that it will
                            become more recognizable.</p>
                        <p>Improved exposure will make your business stand out among your competitors, and in turn, influence your site’s reputation and ranking.</p>

                    <h3>What is a Sitemap?</h3>
                    <div class="insights-data-inner custom-scroll">
                        <p>Search engines are fully committed to displaying the most relevant results for any given query. To this purpose, crawlers or bots read, organize, and index all data on the internet. They are responsible for navigating through your
                            site and identifying what your content is about and whether it’s valuable enough to show users. If they find it so, they’ll place your site somewhere among the SERPs. Creating a sitemap of your website can help boost your its
                            rankings.
                        </p>
                        <p>Sitemaps or XML sitemaps are a list of all existing pages on a given website. XML stands for ‘extensible markup language,’ and works as a way to display information that’s both human and machine-readable. At its core, a sitemap
                            makes a crawler’s job easier, as they help them index your site correctly.</p>
                        <p>Your website’s sitemap will tell search engines the following information:</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; The location of a specific page on your website.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; The exact time when it was updated.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; How frequent is a given update happening.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; How important is that particular page within your site</p>
                        <p>As much as a well-done sitemap will help your SEO efforts, a poorly done one will do the opposite. In the latter case, crawlers could index some of your content as duplicate, which could end up hurting your SEO efforts tremendously.
                        </p>
                        <h2>How can I create a Sitemap?</h2>
                        <p>If you want your website to be easily and quickly indexed, you need to follow a few steps to create a useful XML sitemap.</p>
                        <p>First, you must determine your site’s existing architecture. How is it structured? Identifying your pages hierarchies is essential to building a successful sitemap. For SEO purposes, you need to be aware of those pages that may
                            be too deep. Those that are further away from your homepage can be difficult for crawlers (and users) to access. One recommendation is to keep your site structure’s depth shallow, meaning that it shouldn’t take that many clicks
                            to navigate your site.</p>
                        <p>After you have optimized your page’s hierarchy, you can begin coding your URLs. This is done by formatting each URL with XML tags. If you don’t have any experience with coding, there are tools available to help you set it up. When
                            creating the format, you need to add four attributes to your pages:</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; Location</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; Last changed</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; Frequency</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; The priority of a page</p>
                        <p>Then, using a sitemap validator, verify your code to make sure it is error-free. At this point, you’ll have your XML sitemap ready to go. The next step is to add it to your website’s root. Keep a logical and clear hierarchy while
                            doing this, as it will be crucial when crawlers are scanning your site.</p>
                        <p>Lastly, you need to submit your new sitemap to search engines. To do this, you need to add it to your robots.txt file or <a href="https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/183668?hl=en">submit it directly to
                                Search Console</a> (Google) and Bing Webmaster Tools (Bing and Yahoo!). This will let crawlers know that your sitemap exists.

                    <h3>What are Sitewide Links?</h3>
                    <div class="insights-data-inner custom-scroll">
                        <p>Backlinks are considered a top priority when it comes to rankings, as search engines use them to identify a site’s authority. But, throughout the years, a series of updates have established that when it comes to links, quality
                            matters more than quantity. Link building strategies are a must in your SEO campaign. Ideally, you want to get natural or organic backlinks, those that your site obtains for creating valuable and relevant content.
                        </p>
                        <p>Sitewide links are becoming a very debatable topic among the SEO community. Some claim that implementing them is right for your overall campaign, and others think not so much. So, what exactly is a sitewide link?</p>
                        <p>It’s a link that appears on most (or all) of a website’s pages. But, when using sitewide links, you need to be careful. Depending on how you implement them, they can end up flagged as spam. Here are two common places where sitewide
                            links may appear:</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; At the footer. If a site uses a template for its footer, any link added there will likely be a sitewide link. However, this tactic is risky. They are commonly abused by website owners, and search engines can view
                            them as paid links.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; At a site’s sidebar. A list of these links appears on the side of every page of a website. Many argue that these can be even more detrimental than footer links. They occupy a larger space within a site, and thus,
                            they are easy for search engines to spot.</p>
                        <p>If you work in an industry where you offer services, including a small mention of your business at the footer of your client’s pages, won’t cause any problem. Also, if you are known for posting multiple publications on separate
                            websites, then linking those sites together would be entirely natural for search engines. However, you must keep relevancy within topics. The content on both or more publications needs to match the subject, so crawlers understand
                            their connection.</p>

                    <h3>What is Skyscraping?</h3>
                    <div class="insights-data-inner custom-scroll">
                        <p>In SEO, link building strategies are well known to drive more traffic to your site and increase its authority among search engines. Many methods have been implemented by website owners to optimize their backlinks. In 2015, a new
                            technique called The Skyscraper was introduced. Its primary purpose is to improve on existing popular content and replicate its backlinks.</p>
                        <h2>How does Skyscraping work?</h2>
                        <p>The method works under the premise that people are always interested in finding the best information. Even if they already have read a fantastic article about a given topic, users always crave better content. To execute this technique,
                            you need to follow three steps.</p>
                        <p>1. Explore the web to find the best pieces of content in your niche. Pick one that has many backlinks, and it’s popular among your niche. You can do this by using tools like Content Explorer or Site Explorer.</p>
                        <p>2.After establishing which topic you want to work on, begin your process by creating something way better. It’s time to grab that piece of content and take it to the next level. Mainly, you want to improve these four aspects:
                        </p>
                        <p> – Length. Can you make it longer without compromising its value and relevancy? Just because a post is exceptionally long doesn’t mean that users find it relevant or engaging. If the topic has room for longer content, then go right
                            ahead.
                        </p>
                        <p> – Freshness. Pick those articles that appear out of date. Add new layers to them (images, videos, up-to-date info, etc.) and make them relevant to today’s trends.</p>
                        <p> – Design.Is the post poorly presented? Appeal to visual aids to make your content and information pop.</p>
                        <p> – Depth. Make sure that the information on your pages has substance. You should only write pieces that are informative and beneficial for your users.</p>
                        <p>3.Your next task is to reach out to the right people. Here is where email outreach comes into play. Find people who have already linked to the specific content you took inspiration from. This way, you guarantee that they will be
                            interested in what you have to offer. Build strong relationships and reach out to them personally. Well-crafted, personalized emails will determine your success in this step.</p>

                    <div class="insights-data-inner custom-scroll">
                        <p>With the internet’s rapid rising, social media is becoming more and more influential these days. Currently, there are an estimated <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/278414/number-of-worldwide-social-network-users/">2.7
                                billion social media users</a> worldwide. This represents an enormous array of opportunities for your business to grow if you leverage your social media channels effectively.
                        </p>
                        <p>How can you do this? With Social Media Marketing or “SMM.” Social media marketing involves creating and sharing content on – you guessed it –your (business’s) social media networks. This can help you reach and interact with your
                            prospects directly and achieve your marketing and branding goals.</p>
                        <p>SMM consists of creating and posting different types of content in one or several social media networks and promoting content through paid partnerships and sponsorships to drive user engagement. It’s a fresh way to deliver content
                            and keep your target audience engaged and interested in your brand.</p>
                        <p>Before starting an SMM campaign, it’s imperative that you set goals. Going into it without clear objectives is a recipe for failure. Ask yourself a series of questions to get a better sense of what you want to achieve.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; Who is your target audience? If you have an already established business, you should know this already. If not, it’s time you do. Clearly identify who your market is and tailor your content accordingly.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; Where is your audience located? and how do they use social media? These questions are fundamental. They will help you define which strategies you can implement to reach out to them effectively.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; What message do you want to send to your readers? You need to know how you want to be portrayed. How you come across to your audience is essential if you want your campaign to thrive.
                        </p>
                        <p>The platform or platforms you use and the type of content you publish will be settled once you have answered all those questions.</p>
                        <h2>What are the benefits of using social media as a marketing platform?</h2>
                        <p>If done right, social media marketing can help you:</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; Boost your website traffic. People spend most of their time on their phones these days. If they see valuable and relevant content, they won’t hesitate to read it and share it. The right social media strategy for
                            your brand can increase your conversion rate.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; Increase brand awareness. If your business is starting, this strategy can work flawlessly for you. Your main goal should be the creation of your brand identity and its subsequent associations.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; Reach your audience directly. Relating to them in a humanly way is excellent for building your brand identity and for eliciting positive brand association.</p>

                    <h3>What Are Social Signals?</h3>
                    <div class="insights-data-inner custom-scroll">
                        <p>Social platforms have a series of features that display human interactions. They are called social signals, and they also serve as metrics for social media marketing. Some examples of social signals include likes, dislikes, shares,
                            votes, pins, views, etc. With them, business owners can measure how popular their content is and if people identify with it.</p>
                        <p>Virtually every brand or company has a social media account associated with their website. Whether they rely on Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram, or other social network, businesses can use these to get their message across
                            for a wide range of people.</p>
                        <p>SEO experts argue that social signals didn’t have much weight as ranking factors in the past. However, with the never-ending development of search engines’ algorithms, it’s no wonder that they are now taken into consideration.
                            Mostly, they are a way to increase your rankings organically.</p>
                        <p>Social signals can impact rankings directly or indirectly. Direct impacts can derive from:
                        </p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; The amount of people that like your company on Facebook.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; The total number of Facebook shares.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; Amount of Twitter followers.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; The number of tweets that specially mention your brand name.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; Number of people who liked your Instagram post.</p>
                        <p>These are measures of how well-received your content is. If your numbers are high, it is an indication that users find your content relevant and interesting.</p>
                        <p>Indirect impacts derive from:</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; An increment on your inbound links and citations due to online visibility and brand awareness.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; An increase in your site’s reviews thanks to more satisfied customers.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; A decrease in your website’s bounce rate, higher time on site, and more repeat visitors.
                        </p>
                        <p>Social signals are sure to take the future of SEO by storm. The newer generations have been raised to keep up with social media channels. Through them, they are able to find products they like and engage with their favorite content
                            creators. Also, they are more prone to trust websites recommended by their friends or by an influencer than by search engines.</p>

                    <h3>What is Social Media Syndication?</h3>
                    <div class="insights-data-inner custom-scroll">
                        <p>Content syndication is publishing and promoting original web content through one or more third-party websites. The given information expands to articles, blogs, and videos. This strategy is known to drive organic traffic to your
                            site and increase its visibility among SERPs.</p>
                        <p>Due to the widespread use of social media channels these days, it’s only logical that a similar term would apply to them. This is the case of social media syndication, and it refers to the method of sharing your blog or website
                            page onto your social media accounts or those of brand partners.</p>
                        <p>Many tools allow you to program when and where you want your content published, and how often. It’s a great alternative to paid marketing campaigns where businesses often spend thousands or even hundreds of thousands of dollars
                            to make their brand stand out. With social media, the possibilities are endless. You can utilize compelling posts, live videos, tutorials, partnerships, and so much more.</p>
                        <h2>What are the best practices for social media syndication?</h2>
                        <p>As with anything, strategies need to be implemented effectively to have a positive outcome. Although social syndication seems easy enough, bad execution can end up hurting your business.
                        </p>
                        <p>The first (and most important) aspect you need to keep in mind is your target audience. Social media platforms rely on the personal touch. Establishing communication with your users is crucial for a good syndication strategy. Publish
                            content tailored to their needs, and if you can, use surveys to know what they’d like to see or learn.
                        </p>
                        <p>Social media syndication may not be successful right away. That’s why you need to test it over and over again. Figure out what works best for your brand and what type of content are users engaging with the most. Testing will let
                            you know the following factors:</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; The best hours to post.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; How long your posts should be.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; Which call-to-actions to include.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; What effects different images are having.</p>
                        <p>Lastly, don’t limit yourself to only one social media platform. Even though Facebook is extremely popular these days, other channels like Twitter and Instagram have proven to be equally important in driving qualified traffic. It
                            all depends on who your market is and which social media platform or platforms they prefer.

                        <p>How many times have you received an unwanted or suspicious mail in your inbox? How many times have you entered a site and saw a bunch of ads that are irrelevant to the site’s alleged content? I bet it’s been quite a few times.
                            These annoying and frustrating forms of communication are considered spam.</p>
                        <p>Spam is any kind of unwelcomed, unrequested digital communication. The most common and prevalent form of spam is through email. Spam emails are the most aggressive and irritating ones for users and are typically sent in bulk.&nbsp;Ever
                            since the birth of the internet, spam has been present. It is always lurking in the shadows, waiting to claim its next victim.</p>
                        <p>Use two-factor authentication for your email or other apps that allow you to implement it to prevent information phishing. This protects you against possible hackers trying to steal your information. They might be able to get your
                            username and password, but not the other pieces of information they need to access your account.
                        </p>
                        <h2>Webspam</h2>
                        <p>Spam messages can be found on forums, text messages, blog comments, and social media. For both users and search engines, spam is a waste of time and resources. It can be present on your website due to several things. Sometimes,
                            it happens without your knowledge, introduced by hackers or via intrusive marketing campaigns. Exposing your site to hackers can result in more than merely annoying messages. When this happens, you need to address it fast.</p>
                        <p>That said, some business owners out there purposively implement what are called black hat SEO techniques. These refer to those frowned upon methods that violate search engines guidelines and best practices. Such is the case of
                            keyword or link stuffing. Ultimately, these procedures are seen as spam and can get your site penalized. Resorting to these methods could bury your site on page 100 of search results. You’ll be hindering your site’s ability
                            to drive organic traffic and gain any visibility among SERPs.</p>

                    <div class="insights-data-inner custom-scroll">
                        <p>Any website owner’s nightmare is to have their site penalized. Whether you participated in black hat SEO techniques or have problems with your marketing campaign, you wouldn’t want your website to be removed from a search engine’s
                            index. One crucial aspect you need to avoid on your site is spam. All that unwanted and unsolicited information that appears in your pages or channels needs to go and fast.</p>
                        <p>For that purpose, Moz, an SEO software developer company, created a way to calculate “the percentage of sites with similar features that have been penalized or banned by Google.” They have identified 27 common denominators in websites
                            that have been penalized or banned by Google and used them to evaluate a domain. The metric, which can be obtained through the Link Explorer, is called <a href="https://moz.com/help/link-explorer/link-building/spam-score">Spam Score</a>.
                            The tool provides several data sets that allow you to evaluate your site’s quality.</p>
                        <p>A site with a high Spam Score is not necessarily spammy. However, it means that you need to assess your site’s quality and relevance.</p>
                        <h2><strong>What are the uses of this metric?</strong></h2>
                        <p>Spam Score encompasses a wide array of potential red flags, from thin content to low authority to URL length. It is important to note that the score does not follow a causation relationship but rather a correlation one.&nbsp;This
                            means that the solution is not about changing the problem factors within your site or disavowing a site that has a high Spam Score. In both cases, it is necessary to examine each of the features that are used in the analysis
                            to determine where the root of the low score may be. In the case of an external site, before disavowing or asking them to remove the link, assess the quality and relevance of the content linking to your site.

                        <p>Nowadays, there is a massive chunk of dubious strategies that help increase a site’s ranking, albeit momentarily. They go from lousy typography to poorly executed advertisements like pop-ups. Here are some of the most popular spammy
                            tactics that people find themselves relying on. Some of these tactics include:</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; Duplicate content. Your website’s content is the most precious aspect of your SEO campaign. It’s well known that the information you deliver should be valuable and relevant to your target audience, but also original.
                            Using the same content on all your pages will be flagged as spam. This tactic will get your site penalized in no time.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; Keyword stuffing. Keywords are the backbone of any SEO campaign. Without them, your chances of ranking high among the SERPs is low to nonexistent. However, you need to target them appropriately, match them with your
                            site’s content, and place them strategically throughout your site. If you overdo it, you’ll be falling into keyword stuffing. In this practice, people cram up as many keywords as possible in a single piece of content. Doing
                            this will not get you higher rankings and search engines punish it severely.</p>
                        <p> – Interstitials. These refer to content that blocks or interrupts user experience. Depending on their intrusiveness, they can take many forms. Pop-ups are the most popular and frustrating ones. Hindering users navigating your site
                            with ease will bring serious consequences.</p>

                    <h3>What is a Spider?</h3>
                    <div class="insights-data-inner custom-scroll">
                        <p>Search engines implement a crawling and indexing process that allows us to find virtually any information we are looking for on the internet. With those processes, they are able to analyze pages and identify which are relevant
                            to a specific user query.</p>
                        <p>But how exactly do they do this?</p>
                        <p>They have a built-in computer program that automatically searches documents on the internet. Commonly known as crawlers, spiders, or bots. They are in charge of navigating through sites looking for information and categorizing
                            it. Spiders are programmed for repetitive actions so that browsing is automated.</p>
                        <h2>How do Spiders work?</h2>
                        <p>In order to gather all the information search engines need to render relevant results, spiders take three steps:</p>
                        <p>First, they scan throughout the internet looking for information. Then, they assign the information they find to certain categories depending on the content and its context. Third, they index and catalog those pages that are relevant,
                            so the information is available for users.</p>
                        <p>Besides being responsible for indexing websites, spiders can also be used for other purposes. These include:</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; Assist in price comparison for products on the internet. They search for information about products so that prices or data can be compared accurately.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; Work in the area of data mining. They collect emails or companies’ addresses that are available to the public.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; Collection of data for page views, or incoming or outbound links.</p>
                        <p>There are a few ways for you to block spiders from accessing your site. Implementing what it’s called a crawler directive, you’ll be instructing them not to browse or index specific pages within your website. The most popular instructions
                            are meta tags and robots.txt. For example, if you don’t want one of your pages to be indexed by search engines, then adding the noindex tag should do the trick.</p>

                <div class="insights-data" data-info="What is a Splash Page?">
                    <h3>What is a Splash Page?</h3>
                    <div class="insights-data-inner custom-scroll">
                        <p>For those new to search engine optimization, learning all the specific terms can be challenging at first. There are so many definitions you need to know to communicate with your peers or with SEO professionals effectively. Let’s
                            take webpages as an example. When it comes to pages, there are two definitions that people often misinterpret. These are landing and splash pages. There’s a vast difference between the two of them and knowing what each of them
                            is about is crucial to ensure your site offers a great user experience.</p>
                        <p>A landing page is a standalone page created to fulfill a conversion goal. Typically, it involves a contact form that users need to fill to get a specific reward — the most popular being a sign-up form.</p>
                        <p>A splash page, on the other hand, is a screen that pops up when a user first enters a site. It’s basically the introduction to your website, and it delivers critical information, like a promotion or an appropriate disclaimer. Within
                            these pages, website owners have the opportunity to evoke specific emotions from their visitors. If they succeed at it, their conversion rate will surely increment.</p>
                        <p>The main difference between the two is that splash pages aren’t designed to ask their users for personal information. This means that people are not required to enter their name or email address upon viewing this type of page.
                            A customary splash page contains minimal copy, a background image, and a link that takes visitors to the homepage.
                        </p>
                        <p>Poor implementation of these pages can end up hurting your site’s performance; not to mention user experience. People who come into your site will ignore splash pages that add little to no value to your overall offer or to user
                            experience. Also, search engines have begun penalizing websites that host a lousy splash page design.</p>
                        <p>Optimizing them, so it doesn’t affect user experience is vital for your SEO strategy. Make sure that they are not too intrusive and that they are there to communicate a specific and relevant message.

                    <h3>What is Split Testing?</h3>
                    <div class="insights-data-inner custom-scroll">
                        <p>Search Engine Optimization is vital when running an online business. Assuring that your website always works at its full capacity will make your rankings increase among SERPs. These strategies don’t deliver benefits overnight,
                            and sometimes, a lot of experimenting is involved.</p>
                        <p>Split testing (or A/B testing) is the process of conducting precise and randomized tests. Its primary purpose is to improve a website’s metrics such as clicks, form completions, or purchases.
                        </p>
                        <h2>How does it work?</h2>
                        <p>The process is relatively simple. Your website’s traffic is spread between the original page and one or more variations of it. People who visit your site are unaware of this experiment. Then, the tester waits until a significant
                            difference in user behavior surfaces. Lastly, the results from each variation are compared to determine which one performed the best.</p>
                        <p>This method is often employed to test changes in forms, registration pages, calls-to-action (CTAs), or any other factor within a website that’s measurable.</p>
                        <p>Marketers and web developers test many features to optimize a website properly. Some of them may include:
                        </p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; Pictures, videos, and colors.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; Meta descriptions, headers, and calls-to-action.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; The specific arrangement of buttons, menus, and forms.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; A website’s flow: how users get from point A to B.</p>
                        <p>Implementing split testing can help increase a site’s rankings among SERPs. However, there are a few things you need to keep in mind when carrying out the process.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; Don’t focus on too many elements. Pick the most relevant to your current problems for the test. That way, you’ll be creating fewer distractions from the ultimate conversion goal.
                        </p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; Keep a close eye on CTAs. Not everyone reacts the same to these, so, studying user behavior is necessary to understand what draws the attention/action of most.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; Don’t drive all your attention to individual pages. Implement the testing with a global goal in mind. Your emphasis should be to find what works best for the website as a whole.
                        </p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; Keep the changes consistent throughout the entire trial. This will improve conversions and flow at every step of the process.</p>

                    <h3>What is an SSL Certificate?</h3>
                    <div class="insights-data-inner custom-scroll">
                        <p>For search engines, a website’s security is of the utmost importance. In fact, Google started using <a href="https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2014/08/https-as-ranking-signal.html">HTTPS as
                                a ranking signal</a> in 2014. If a page renders as secure, it will serve as a vote of confidence for search engines, and thus, it will increase its rankings on SERPs. To make your site safe, you need to implement an SSL
                            Certificate.
                        </p>
                        <p>SSL Certificates are small data files that digitally connect a cryptographic key to a company’s details. They are installed on a web server and are responsible for activating the padlock and HTTPS protocol. The latter is extremely
                            important to ensure a secure connection between a browser and a server. They are also responsible for providing secure credit card transactions and data transfers. Recently, they’re also becoming popular for fortifying browsing
                            of social media sites.</p>
                        <p>Providing secure connections is crucial for user experience. Who would want to enter a site only to see that their information is not safe? By adding this layer of security, you’ll be guaranteeing that your users feel safe and
                            confident while navigating your site.</p>
                        <p>Here are some of the advantages that buying an SSL Certificate will bring to your site:</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; It encrypts sensitive information. An SSL certificate is necessary to prevent hackers from getting a hold of your information (or your visitors’). The information becomes unreadable to anyone except the intended
                            recipient.
                        </p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; It provides authentication. With the certificate enabled, you can rest easy knowing that the information you are sending is landing on the right server. This practice prevents information from falling into the hands
                            of hackers or identity thieves who only want to steal your data.</p>
                        <p>An SSL Certificate is also beneficial for your site’s ranking. Since you are playing by the book and following search engines’ guideline of establishing secure connections, crawlers can identify your site as trustworthy. Additionally,
                            it will allow you to build and enhance customer trust.</p>

                    <h3>What are Static URLs?</h3>
                    <div class="insights-data-inner custom-scroll">
                        <p>For search engines, every little detail about your website matters. They take into consideration hundreds of factors when indexing and ranking your pages. Thus, your SEO strategies need to take into consideration all the factors
                            that can be controlled from your end to ensure your site’s success. A little aspect of websites that people sometimes disregard is the URLs.</p>
                        <p>Mainly, there are two types of URLs: dynamic and static. The first one leads to dynamic pages that change according to a specific user. They can be personalized or updated on a regular basis. These changes don’t require any human
                            input as they are conducted automatically through databases.</p>
                        <p>Static URLs, on the other hand, lead to webpages that always remain as they are. Thus, they are not customizable for users. Every person who enters the site will see the same information in all the pages they visit.</p>
                        <p>The specific type of URL you should use is a somewhat debatable topic among the SEO community. Although Google has stated that it has no issues with crawling dynamic URLs, it’s commonly known that they are not precisely friendly
                            for users or search engines. Some experts argue that you should change all your URLs to static to avoid any problem down the road, some consider it unnecessary. However, when you weigh the pros and cons of having static vs.
                            dynamic URL, the decision seems like a no brainer.</p>
                        <p>Here are some of the pros of using static URLs:</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; Your click-through rate among SERPs and web pages can increase.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; Your target keywords will become more prominent and relevant.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; Static URLs are easier for people to copy, paste, link, or share both on and offline.
                        </p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; They are easy to remember and are commonly used in branding and offline media.
                        </p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; Users identify the subject of the page more accurately.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; Well-written URLs contain good anchor text that helps the page rank higher when using a naked link.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; These URLs are preferred by most search engines. They are able to handle them better, particularly if there are multiple parameters.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Static URLs can pose a problem if you make a mistake in the rewriting process. In this case, both users and search engines will struggle to find content on your site.</p>

                    <h3>What is a Status Code?</h3>
                    <div class="insights-data-inner custom-scroll">
                        <p>HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol and is the&nbsp;protocol&nbsp;used to transfer data over the&nbsp;<a href="https://techterms.com/definition/www">web</a>. If a webpage fails to load, it will render an HTTP status code.
                        </p>
                        <p>When talking about HTTP status codes, we are referring to those responses given by website servers that are considered standard. Their primary purpose is to identify the cause of a problem when a webpage or other resource does
                            not load correctly. They are sometimes called browser error codes or internet error codes.
                        </p>
                        <p>So, how can we read these status codes?</p>
                        <p>HTTP response status codes are divided into five categories. The first digit of the code defines the class of response. The last two digits don’t pertain to any type or categorization role. There are five values for the first digit:
                        </p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; 1.These are informational and mean that the request was received.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; 2.These are counted as successful. Here, the request was received, understood, and accepted.
                        </p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; 3.These fall into the redirection category. A search engine needs to take further action to complete the request.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; 4.Also known as client errors, these contain requests that have the wrong syntax and cannot be completed.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; 5.Lastly, these are known as server errors. As the name suggests, the server has failed to fulfill a (seemingly) valid request.</p>
                        <p>Although there are five categories of HTTP status code errors; there are two that tend to stand out. These are the most common ones, and they are responsible for most SEO professionals’ headaches. These are client and server errors.
                        </p>
                        <p>Some standard client-error HTTP status codes include:</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; 404 (Not Found). Here, the browser was able to communicate with a given server, but the latter couldn’t find what was requested.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; 403 (Forbidden). As the name suggests, this code means that accessing that particular site is completely forbidden. It doesn’t provide a reason for the restriction.
                        </p>
                        <p>Some universal server-error HTTP status codes include:</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; The ever-popular500 (Internal Server Error). Here, the server was unable to process the request. You could restart your browser after clearing its cache and deleting cookies to try to fix the problem.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; 502 (Bad Gateway). It means that the response one server on the web received from another one is invalid.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; 503 (Service Unavailable). This code tells you that the server couldn’t handle the request due to overloading or maintenance.</p>

                    <h3>What are Stop Words?</h3>
                    <div class="insights-data-inner custom-scroll">
                        <p>Stop words those that are skipped or filtered out by search engines. They are words that occur in natural language but have little to no meaning by themselves. Examples of stop words include an, the, in, many, about, after, if,
                            etc. Here, you can find a <a href="https://www.link-assistant.com/seo-stop-words.html">comprehensive
                                list of stop words</a>.</p>
                        <p>Many SEO professionals consider that using stop words can hinder a site’s ranking on search engine result pages. However, this is not entirely accurate.</p>
                        <p>It is true that most of the times, they are not useful for SEO purposes. Search engines skip these words to save space in their database, and to speed up the process of crawling and indexing, but also when retrieving search results.
                        </p>
                        <p>That being said, when one of these words changes the meaning of a query, then search engines do consider it when retrieving results. For example, someone searching for “The Raven” (Edgar Allan Poe’s poem) vs. someone searching
                            for “raven” (information about the bird). In this case, using the stop word “the” does change the meaning of what the searcher needs to find, and search engines will consider it when retrieving results.

                        <h2>How do I decide when to use and when not to use stop words?</h2>
                        <p>An excellent way to determine whether a stop word will compromise your chances of ranking for a given keyword phrase is to search for it with and without the stop word or words. If there are drastic differences in the results shown,
                            i.e., sans the stop words show a lot more results than with it, then you shouldn’t include it in your keyword phrases.</p>
                        <p>A rule of thumb is not to place them too close to your target keywords or between words in a keyword phrase. Including them in the following places can have a negative effect:</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; Title tags</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; Anchor texts</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; Hyperlinks/URLs</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; Meta descriptions</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; Meta titles</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; Image alt text</p>
                        <p>This doesn’t mean that it will get your site penalized for including them, but that another page might get a higher ranking if you use them and they don’t. Thus, your ranking’s on SERPs could be affected.</p>
                        <p>You should use stop words throughout the body of your text naturally. Otherwise, it would be hard or even impossible to read.</p>
                        <p>You need to keep in mind is that while it is called search engine optimization, you’re not only writing for search engines; you’re ultimately doing it for your readers.</p>
                        <p>Finding a balance when it comes to the use of stop words is vital. You’d want to use the less amount of these words as possible while creating content that makes sense to humans and that it is pleasant to read. One way to do this
                            would be to use shorter sentences. In the end, most people don’t want to read long-ass paragraphs anyway.

                <div class="insights-data" data-info="What is a Subdomain?">
                    <h3>What is a Subdomain?</h3>
                    <div class="insights-data-inner custom-scroll">
                        <p>The first step web developers (or you) take when creating a website is choosing its domain. Primarily, it serves as your site’s name and will define its URL. When creating it, you also have the chance to add a subdomain. These
                            are third-level domains that are part of the original top-level one.</p>
                        <p>For example, let’s say the example.com is your primary (or root) domain. Now imagine that your business expands nationally and has branches both on the west and east side. If you want to divide your root domain into more specific
                            ones, you could add the following subdomains: east.example.com or west.example.com.</p>
                        <p>These are often useful when a business expands globally and wants to cater to foreign markets. You’ll need to add a subdomain for your site according to the language you wish to target. Subdomains are also used is by big companies
                            who want to stratify their products.</p>
                        <p>However, if your website does not fall into any of these categories, you should stay clear of subdomains as they can hurt your SEO.</p>
                        <h2>How exactly do search engines evaluate subdomains?</h2>
                        <p>A common question is whether subdomains have any effect on the primary domain when it comes to ranking and indexing. Search engines, at least Google, treats subdomains as separate entities. They are able to build up on their own
                            set of keywords and rank on their own. If you create a subdomain and target relevant words and phrases, you can rank on SERPs -regardless of your root domain’s ranking. However, this opportunity decreases as you create more
                            and more subdomains. As a result of this, you’ll be diluting the effectiveness of keywords. Search engines treat subdomains as separate entities. So, yes, both your primary domain and subdomains can rank high, but separately.
                        </p>
                        <p>Another aspect to keep in mind is backlink dilution. Similar to keywords, your subdomain can have its own link building strategy. Backlinks can also be added to increase its authority and visibility among the SERPs. However, if
                            a subdomain gets a backlink, this will not enrich your root domain’s authority.</p>

                <div class="insights-data" data-info="What is Submission?">
                    <h3>What is Submission?</h3>
                    <div class="insights-data-inner custom-scroll">
                        <p>It is (or it should be) every webmaster’s goal to have their site visible among search engines. Instead of waiting for crawlers to come across their site and index it, they can do what is known as search engine submission. It refers
                            to the action of letting search engines know that your website exists. Usually, crawlers are able to find them organically but, if you have a newly created site, you could use this tactic to let them know manually.
                        </p>
                        <p>By doing so, you’ll be promoting your website and helping it increase their rankings. Also, if you recently updated one of your pages, submitting it to search engines will make them recognize the update more quickly.</p>
                        <p>There are two main methods you can use when it comes to submission: one page at a time or the entire site. Either one of them will depend on your current needs and stage of your website. Typically, people submit only the home page
                            of their site since crawlers are smart enough to scan an entire site after they’ve been directed to the homepage.</p>
                        <p>For the main search engines like Google, Yahoo!, and Bing, the process is relatively simple. For Google, you have two options. You can go to its web page for URL submitting and type your site’s address, or you can send it via the
                            Search Console.
                        </p>
                        <p>If you submit your URL to Bing, it will automatically sync with Yahoo! To do so, you need to log in with your Bing account and through their Webmaster Tools’ page add your URL.</p>
                        <p>Every search engine can have its own URL adding policy. Some of them only ask for your site’s main URL, while for others, you need to submit different pages.</p>
                        <p>There’s a common misconception when it comes to Search Engine Submission and Search Engine Optimization (SEO). The two are in no way related, and their meanings are different. By simply submitting your site, you have no control
                            over your site’s ranking. You are only requesting a specific search engine to include your website in their index. SEO, on the other hand, are those tactics that you implement to enhance your pages to be visible among the SERPs.

                    <h3>What is Qualified Traffic?</h3>
                    <div class="insights-data-inner custom-scroll">
                        <p>Attracting visitors is the perfect indication that your SEO efforts are paying off. However, are you driving relevant traffic to your site? In other words, is the traffic qualified?</p>
                        <p>Qualified traffic refers to those people who make purchasing decisions when entering your website. They are not just visiting the site but are potential customers interested in buying what you’re offering.</p>
                        <p>Although writing quality content and placing online ads can work, there are other elements that you need to pay attention to. For example, if you fail to connect with your readers, chances are you won’t drive qualified organic
                            traffic to your site.</p>
                        <p>The term ‘qualified,’ however, doesn’t mean the same for all companies since not all of them share the same goal. Depending on what that objective is, website owners will define their own parameters for what qualified traffic is.
                        </p>
                        <h2>How Can I Measure Qualified Traffic?</h2>
                        <p>Evaluating your site’s conversion rate is essential when determining qualified traffic. That factor will tell you if you’re succeeding in attracting the right people to your business. Nowadays, marketing automation software exists
                            to help you understand user behavior within your pages. They let you track two main metrics:
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>&nbsp; –&nbsp; Visitor to lead</strong> (VTL) conversion rate. This tells you how many visitors have recently become possible leads (prospective customers interested in your products or services). If your VTL is low, it’s
                            a sign that your website is not driving qualified traffic.</p>
                        <p><strong>&nbsp; –&nbsp; Lead to customer</strong> (LTC) conversion rate. This metric allows you to determine how many users are converting. It’s the perfect metric to know if your marketing efforts are bearing fruits. A low LTC
                            could be catastrophic. It can mean that your marketing efforts are not driving the right traffic, but worse it could be that your sales strategy is not working.</p>
                        <p>Estimating these two parameters will pave the way for your site’s optimization. Depending on your goal and the results you obtained, you can implement the appropriate SEO strategies to take your business to the next level. If possible,
                            work alongside your sales team and come up with strategies to increase qualified traffic and convert them into sales.</p>

                <div class="insights-data" data-info="What is Quality Content?">
                    <h3>What is Quality Content?</h3>
                    <div class="insights-data-inner custom-scroll">
                        <p>For any Search Engine Optimization (SEO) campaign to be successful, there’s a powerful element you need to master: content. I’m sure you’ve read the phrase ‘content is king’ across the web, and probably heard it a few times if
                            you’ve ever worked with digital marketing professionals. Well, it’s true. If your pages don’t have compelling content, your business is doomed to fail.</p>
                        <p>A well-crafted content marketing campaign focuses on statistics rather than attributes. That’s where the difference between regular and quality content lies. You should focus your efforts on the latter. Pay attention to data and
                            create your content based on that. Basing your content strategy on statistics and how your readership reacts to what you publish guarantees that the decision of what to publish is not subjective. This is important because what
                            you may consider high-quality, valuable content can differ from what your readers think.</p>
                        <h2>How Can I Create Quality Content?</h2>
                        <p>If you ask any marketer out there, you’ll get the same response when it comes to content: it’s all about your target audience. If you don’t know who you are writing to, how do you expect your content to be of good enough quality?
                        </p>
                        <p>Immerse yourself in your niche and study what people are searching for. What type of words are they using to find your type of business? What problems do they have right now? Answering those questions will be the basis of your
                            content marketing campaign.</p>
                        <p>After that is established, you must carry out extensive keyword research. Determine which specific words and phrases you need to target within your site to appeal to your target audience’s needs and desires. If possible, establish
                            personal relationships with those people that fit your reader profile, talk to them, and even ask them what they’d be interested in reading or learning.</p>
                        <p>Now that you know what your target market looks like, you can start to publish valuable content. To stand out among your competitors, you need to implement creative and innovative ways when writing any piece. Creating bland and
                            ordinary articles won’t attract as many users as in-depth posts about specific topics. Step out of your comfort zone and craft long-form, useful pieces that cover a subject from all sides and angles.
                        </p>
                        <p>If you choose to write more profound pieces, you need to:</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; Make sure that you provide accurate facts and that you cite them properly.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; Show that you are an expert about the subject of your piece.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; Carry out original research and support it within your articles. Include statistics, related studies, and any relevant information that may be of use for your readers.
                        </p>
                        <p>The technical aspect surrounding your site can also impact the quality of your content. If you publish amazing articles but your page fails to load properly, it will downgrade your users’ experience. The same thing happens if you
                            don’t have a mobile-friendly site. These are aspects that search engines also consider when showing results for a given search query.</p>

                <div class="insights-data" data-info="What Is a Quality Link?">
                    <h3>What Is a Quality Link?</h3>
                    <div class="insights-data-inner custom-scroll">
                        <p>A quality link, or high-quality link, is one that sources from a high-quality website. Backlinks are one of the pillars of an effective SEO strategy. They are essential to driving organic traffic and increasing your site’s authority.
                            In addition, search engines consider them one of their top three ranking factors.</p>
                        <p>There are many SEO auditing tools that can help you analyze your backlinks’ performance. They let you decide whether earning a link from a specific site is worth your time and effort. Auditing tools determine if any given link
                            is authoritative enough for it to try to pursue them linking back to your site. They evaluate the value of a link by establishing Domain Authority (DA) and other proprietary metrics. However, obtaining a high DA number doesn’t
                            mean that a particular website is a good match for you -or even an overall high-quality link.
                        </p>
                        <h2>What Are Good Quality Websites?</h2>
                        <p>You need to study several factors before deciding on which companies you want your backlinks shown. You want to find a site that drives a consistent amount of monthly traffic.</p>
                        <p>Websites that have expertly trained staff to review their content before publishing is a huge plus. You wouldn’t want backlinks on pages that have low-grade or irrelevant content. You also must make sure that the sites rank high
                            for the keywords they target and they should be relevant to your own niche.</p>
                        <p>Overall, you want those sites that share the same values as you and are considered experts in your niche or related areas.</p>
                        <h2>What Is My Role When Selecting Quality Links?</h2>
                        <p>Now, having backlinks doesn’t solely depend on the authority of your competitors. What about your own authority? What about your content? Your site needs to be correctly optimized and provide useful and relevant information, so
                            other people are willing to mention you. If your content is not valuable, your chances of visibility among SERPs are slim. Nobody wants to link to mediocre pages.</p>
                        <p>There are two ways you can go about this:</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; Write original content for other people to discover, or</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; Reach out to sites that have already linked to content similar to yours and provide them with a better offer.</p>
                        <p>The latter is an opportunity to reinvent yourself and gives you the chance to promote new content.
                        </p>
                        <p>For you to maintain or climb your way up the ranking ladder, you need to find creative ways to up your game. While obtaining quality backlinks can be somewhat challenging, they are necessary to gain authority and relevancy, two
                            of the main ranking factors for search engines. A well-though-out link building strategy will make your site stand out among SERPs.</p>

                        <p>It’s commonly known that search engines (especially Google) use hundreds of ranking factors to influence search results. Mainly, four groups encompass all those metrics:</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; Technical SEO</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; On-page SEO</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; Off-page SEO</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; Performance SEO, and</p>
                        <p>SERP analysis</p>
                        <p>Within each group, there are different aspects that search engines take into consideration when ranking and indexing sites.</p>
                        <p>Query Deserves Diversity (QDD) is an algorithm that SEO experts believe is implemented by Google to adjust results to provide broader match results to searchers.</p>
                        <h2>How does Query Deserves Diversity work?</h2>
                        <p>The primary purpose of QDD is to display relevant results pertaining to specific queries but in a broader spectrum. It shows a varied set of results that meet different needs, even though it’s not entirely sure of what the particular
                            searcher intent is.</p>
                        <p>Google has a user-feedback feature that it uses to understand the requirements surrounding a given query. Thanks to that tool, the search engine is able to identify that queries are not always that evident. QDD allows Google to
                            provide a more diverse array of results when searcher intent is not evident.</p>
                        <p>Google also monitors what users do after results for a search query are retrieved. It knows everything from where your mouse is pointing at to how many search results you are clicking on. On top of that, if you have the Google
                            Analytics feature enabled on your site, the search engine is able to draw data from it as well.
                        </p>
                        <p>By combining all of those processes, Google can get a sense of what users are both doing and searching. Thus, it’s able to understand specific user intent and display results that are relevant to that.</p>

                        <p>Query Deserves Freshness (QDF) is another part of Google’s core algorithm used for ranking search results. Everything trendy and newsworthy falls into the QDF category.</p>
                        <p>Google uses it all the time to display time-sensitive information. It shows relevant events that are happening over a short period. It’s the algorithm responsible for displaying news articles, live events, concerts, conferences,

                        <p>QDF is an indication that a particular site’s content is trendy and up to date. The search engine started to favor those posts and articles that were touching relevant and current topics. For some, this didn’t pose any problem.
                            Twitter and Facebook, for example, weren’t affected by the algorithm since their content is always up to date.
                        </p>
                        <p>That being said, you can implement a few strategies to leverage QDF to your benefit:</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; Take a look at your most popular existing content. Select those pieces that had the biggest number of likes, impressions, etc., and work on updating them. Include new information that maybe wasn’t available at the
                            time of its publication.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; Share your content in your social media channels to increase exposure. Let your readers know every time you publish new content.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; If your site stands out for delivering trendy information, keep an eye on content frequency. Nowadays, users want to be on top of everything. If you specialize in giving readers useful information, try to shorten
                            your publishing period between articles.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; Reinvent yourself and find new creatives ways to deliver content. With all the tools available these days, resorting to more engaging and compelling ways to share information is vital. Writing a post full of text
                            is not enough in this ever-expanding digital world. You can use images, videos, GIFs; and other media to stand out from your competitors.</p>

                <div class="insights-data" data-info="What is JavaScript?">
                    <h3>What is JavaScript?</h3>
                    <div class="insights-data-inner custom-scroll">
                        <p>JavaScript is a programming language developed by Netscape that is used to add interactivity, animation, and automation to websites. For web developers, three elements are essential when designing websites from scratch: HTML, CSS,
                            and JavaScript.</p>
                        <p>HTML is basically the core of your website, and it is the one that gives it structure. Although it is the most important one, this code is static and doesn’t add much functionality or dynamic elements to the page. CSS goes a little
                            beyond that and allows you to style the HTML code. With CSS, you are able to add color, backgrounds, layouts, and other formatting features. You can add this directly on the HTML code or in a separate file.
                        </p>
                        <p>One difference between HTML and JavaScript is that the latter works with client-based scripting. This means that the code is processed on the client’s side, in this case, your computer browser. HTML, on the other hand, runs on
                            server-side scripting, processing the information on the servers.</p>
                        <p>JavaScript code can be written directly in the HTML source code, by using the &lt;script&gt; function or tags. Or, it can be linked/referenced as a separate document like in CSS. JavaScript has a great number of libraries and platforms,
                            which include jQuery, AngularJS, ReactJS, EmberJS, and more. These libraries are pre-written JavaScript that ease the work for web developers.</p>
                        <h3>How important is JavaScript for SEO?</h3>
                        <p>Crawlability, the ability a search engine has to crawl a website, is very important. Crawlers or bots need to scan your website so search engines can have an idea of what it contains. Sometimes, search engines are be blocked from
                            crawling JavaScript, making it impossible for them to examine your site. Since they do not see the whole content of your website, they could flag this as cloaking. Cloaking is purposely hiding content from your site or presenting
                            users and search engines with different versions of your site. This can hinder your website’s ranking.

                <div class="insights-data" data-info="What is JSON-LD?">
                    <h3>What is JSON-LD?</h3>
                    <div class="insights-data-inner custom-scroll">
                        <p>The term stands for JavaScript Object Notation for Linked Data. It’s a lightweight Linked Data format, and its sole purpose is to structure data. JSON-LD is analogous to Microdata and RDFa, and it implements the Schema.org vocabulary.
                            This vocabulary covers entities, which are define by Google as “<em>A thing or concept that
                                is
                                singular, unique, well-defined and distinguishable,</em>” and the relationships between them.
                        </p>
                        <p>The base of JavaScript Object Notation for Linked Data is the JSON format. With this format, it is possible to structure and map data, and in some cases, send the information from a server to the web. Search engines use these configurations
                            to find and access data more directly and automatically.</p>
                        <h3>How does JSON-LD work?</h3>
                        <p>JSON-LD takes the elements of a page, and it structures them, so search engines can make sense of them. Search engines then analyze the data and create facts about the entities, creating a more organized web.</p>
                        <p>Similar to JavaScript, the JSON-LD code can be written in the HTML document. It is commonly placed on the &lt;head&gt; section of the file, but sometimes, it is also stored on the &lt;body&gt; section.</p>
                        <p>JSON-LD classifies the data and labels it individually. For example, in a snippet of JSON-LD code, the following website’s information can be mapped:</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; Name</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; URL</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; Contact information</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; Type</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; – Address</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div class="insights-data" data-info="What is Caching?">
                    <h3>What is Caching?</h3>
                    <div class="insights-data-inner custom-scroll">
                        <p>Caching is the process in which calculated values are stored in a temporary storage area called cache. The files are saved in the computer’s “random access memory” (RAM). Every time a calculated cache value is requested, the browser
                            will pull the value from the cache memory.</p>
                        <h3>How does caching work?</h3>
                        <p>The first time you visit a website, the browser needs to load everything on the HTML code (headers, footers, widgets, etc.). After the request is made, and it gets processed on the servers, the resulting site is sent to your browser.
                            When caching is enabled, the browser saves the HTML file into the RAM. So, the next time you visit that page, a significant part of the site’s code is already stored in your device’s RAM. Then, it can access the stored information
                            instead of making the same calculations every time you go to the site, taking less time to load pages that have been cached.</p>
                        <h3>How does caching affect loading speed, and why is this important?</h3>
                        <p>You can use HTML caching to improve your site’s loading speed, which can affect your website’s ranking and indexing, but it also has an impact on user experience.</p>
                        <p>No one wants to enter a website and wait for it to load forever (and by forever, we mean 5 seconds tops). Site’s speed can be crucial for its performance. If it takes too long to load, you may be losing potential customers.</p>
                        <p>As we stated before, search engines like Google consider a sites’ speed at the time of indexing and ranking them. There are two main reasons for this. The first one is that Google wants to present its users with the best search
                            results available for their query. A website that takes too long to load is far from that. The second reason is that a slow page affects the crawling budget. So, the bots would crawl fewer pages in your slow site than if you
                            had one with optimized speed.</p>
                        <p>When left unattended, this problem can jeopardize your website’s position in the search engine results pages (SERPs), ending up with a low-ranking site that no one will ever find.
                        </p>
                        <p>In a nutshell, the faster your site loads, the better.</p>
                        <p>How can caching help? You can leverage browsers’ caching. This means that you can specify how long they should keep the cached data stored locally. If your site’s design and homepage don’t change that often, you can set it up for
                            a year. Every time users request access to your website, the amount of data that needs to be downloaded will be less, and your site loading speed will improve.</p>

                <div class="insights-data" data-info="What is Caffeine?">
                    <h3>What is Caffeine?</h3>
                    <div class="insights-data-inner custom-scroll">
                        <p>Caffeine is a Google update that was introduced on June 8, 2010. It serves as a new and improved web indexing system. This update allowed the most popular search engine to store data more efficiently. By Google estimates, they
                            were also able to display 50% fresher results. These are the results that are ‘timely’ and relevant to what is happening at that exact moment a related query is made.</p>
                        <h3>How does this work?</h3>
                        <p>In order to understand Caffeine, one must first understand how the previous indexing system worked.
                        </p>
                        <p>Pages and content were classified based on the perceived freshness requirements. Then, based on this classification, crawlers were deployed, and while some of them looked for changes, others were tasked to re-index changed pages.
                            If the site appeared to have fresh content, then the bots would add said content fairly quickly. If not, the site would be re-indexed only every couple of weeks. This process was true for most websites out there.</p>
                        <p>The problem with this boils down to the fact that if, for any reason, the content was misclassified as ‘not fresh,’ then relevant information could be missing from the index.</p>
                        <p>With Caffeine, Google was able to do the same process but only in a few seconds. This made the information available in the index much faster, and without losing relevant data.</p>
                        <p>This update brought significant advantages, especially for bloggers and SEO practitioners. Caffeine is continuously working its magic, and every time it finds new content, it updates the information almost immediately, storing
                            the data on the indexes.</p>

                <div class="insights-data" data-info="What is a Call-to-Action?">
                    <h3>What is a Call-to-Action?</h3>
                    <div class="insights-data-inner custom-scroll">
                        <p>A call-to-action (CTA) is a prompt that tells people to take specific actions when reading a piece of content. It describes precisely what the person will encounter upon clicking on it. A CTA takes the form of a button or hyperlink
                            and is well-known to use commands like ‘Log In,’ ‘Free Trial,’ or ‘Sign up,’ among others. They compel your visitors to dig deeper on your site. They can also be used to link other pages within your website. It’s extremely
                            specific, clear, and it doesn’t try to be clever.</p>
                        <h3>Why is it important?</h3>
                        <p>Having clear and multiple calls-to-action will help you increase your site’s conversion rate. They are a way to send a strong message, and it tells your readers that you know what you’re doing. Without a clear CTA on your site,
                            users could get confused as to what steps they need to take once they reach it. If you’re selling a product and don’t have a CTA for the purchase, readers could leave the site, since nothing is prompting them (or allowing them)
                            to buy what you are offering. Digital marketers recommend having 2 to 3 CTAs spread throughout your homepage.
                        </p>
                        <p>If you want people to subscribe to your newsletter, a compelling CTA is essential. Readers need to know that the option is available and that by clicking ‘Subscribe’ or “Sign up,” they will be able to receive more information about
                            your products or services, or even a gift for signing up.</p>
                        <p>They improve the success of your digital advertising campaign. Imagine publishing a PPC ad with all the relevant information about your product or service. They click on it, but you forgot to tell your potential customers what
                            to do next. What do you think will happen? Chances are they’ll move to the next provider. One that clearly leads them through the process of making a purchase. The calls-to-action are what seal the deal in many PPC campaigns.</p>
                        <p>Creating a convincing CTA is simple. There are a few strategies you can use to maximize its effectiveness:
                        </p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; It must have a good design. Make the colors of the button contrast with your theme for it to stand out.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; Make it reasonably big. The font size must be legible and large enough for the readers to see.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; Don’t make the message too long. Short phrases work best.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; Its intent must be clear. Clear calls-to-action will let the user know what they are getting when they click on the prompt.</p>

                <div class="insights-data" data-info="What is a Canonical URL or Canonical Tag?">
                    <h3>What is a Canonical URL or Canonical Tag?</h3>
                    <div class="insights-data-inner custom-scroll">
                        <p>Canonicalization was introduced in 2009 by Google, Bing, and Yahoo! A canonical tag or rel=“canonical” is how you tell search engines that a specific URL is the one you want to be ranked for. They are especially useful when a website
                            has similar or duplicate content in different URLs.</p>
                        <p>Canonicalizing is the best way to go if:</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; The content from the duplicate and the original URL are identical or remarkably similar.
                        </p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; The content from both URLs serves the same search intent.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; You are updating or refreshing your content.</p>
                        <p>With the use of canonical tags, Google intended to eliminate problems with ‘duplicate’ content. These issues occur when the same or very similar content appears on multiple URLs. Sometimes, something as insignificant as different
                            font types in various sections of your website gets marked as duplicate. That’s why using the canonical attribute to mark the original URL is necessary.</p>
                        <p>Duplicate content can have adverse effects on your SEO strategy. Search bots can miss on a lot of relevant information on your website if they must navigate through a lot of duplicate data first. Also, your ranking can take a hit.
                            By confusing the original URL with a different one, your site can drop in the rankings when it comes to search results.</p>
                        <h3>How can I avoid this?</h3>
                        <p>There are ways to canonicalize multiple URLs and save you some problems.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; Rel=canonical. This is simply a line of code in your HTML document that tells search engines that this particular URL is the original. It allows search engines to determine which sites to display on the SERPs.
                        </p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; 301 redirect. It’s a code that tells Google to ignore all other URLs and pay attention to the one you want. This is done by redirecting the duplicate URLs to the original.
                        </p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; You can go into your Google Search Console and manually tell Google what parameters you want to be passive.</p>

                    <div class="insights-data-inner custom-scroll">
                        <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is one of the most important tools for web developers. It’s a language that allows you to style your website however you want by applying the commands to your HTML source code. You can change the font
                            size, font color, background color, layout, among many other things, using CSS.</p>
                        <p>An advantage of using this tool is that it can let you change the styling on multiple websites that share the same HTML code. If you own more than one site, this feature is convenient. Also, by styling with CSS, you can have a
                            separate document where all the commands are stored. This allows the HTML source code to stay clean and easy to access. Thus, website maintenance becomes much more manageable.</p>
                        <h3>How does CSS improve SEO?</h3>
                        <p>Using CSS can make your website SEO friendly. Search engine bots (or crawlers) can go through your HTML much faster if it’s clean and concise. Bots don’t need to scan through both the HTML and CSS code since the styling is done
                            in a separate document. For web developers, this feature is very convenient, as it gives a sense of order. CSS also makes your site lightweight, which translates into a faster loading speed.
                        </p>
                        <p>Cascading Style Sheets also brings the benefit of arranging your content much more efficiently. The CSS commands make it easier to organize your site and display information in a way that is aesthetically pleasing.</p>
                        <p>CSS uses tags much like HTML. The language uses the &lt;h1&gt; tag to identify the main header. It is something fundamental to keep an eye on since search engines use it to identify valuable and relevant content. Other useful tags
                            are &lt;ul&gt; and &lt;a&gt;.</p>
                        <p>The &lt;ul&gt; tag allows you to create menus and the &lt;a&gt; one stands for ‘anchor.’ The anchor tag is the one responsible for linking content to other areas of your site, making the links easy to find for search engines.

                        <p>The term stands for ‘country code top-level domain,’ and it’s a sequence of characters that have been assigned to a specific geographical area. They are found after the final period of a domain name, and they tell search engines
                            in which country the website is registered. Country code TLDs use the&nbsp;ISO 3166-1 country codes. For example, the site http://www.example.fr has ‘fr’ at the end, which stands for France.

                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; http://www.example.com.<strong>uk</strong>&nbsp;(United Kingdom)</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; – http://example.com.<strong>de</strong> (Germany)</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; – http://example.com.<strong>es</strong> (Spain)</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; – http://example.com.<strong>ae</strong> (United Arab Emirates)</p>
                        <p>There are more than 240 country-based top-level domains, pertaining to the majority of the countries in the world. When you change the location on your computer and try to search for specific information, Google will only display
                            content that is relevant to that area. The ccTLD string will vary according to the country code, and even the language of the website changes.</p>
                        <p>Another type of top-level domain (TLD) is the generic one. Generic (gTLD) domains includes strings like .com, .org, .net, .gov, etc.</p>
                        <p>Although ccTLDs are targeted to certain countries or regions, they are not targeted to a specific language. For example, if you live in Germany, the search engine will recognize ‘de’ as your standard string. But if you speak English
                            and you want to find websites in that language, the search engine would have to make some changes. It will look for German websites that are in English (by adding the ‘en’ string to the domain name).
                        </p>
                        <p>The search engine would then compare sites with both ‘de’ and ‘en’ strings. If both websites have the same quality, authority, and trustworthiness, the ‘de’ will always rank higher because it is the domain name of the country where
                            you’re located.</p>

                <div class="insights-data" data-info="What are Citations?">
                    <h3>What are Citations?</h3>
                    <div class="insights-data-inner custom-scroll">
                        <p>In layman’s terms, a citation is a reference to your business or company name on other peoples’ websites. It works by assigning a NAP, which stands for ‘business Name, Address, and Phone number.’ This allows users to refer to your
                            website more easily. They are also a way Google uses to verify your site’s authority.
                        </p>
                        <h3>How are citations important in SEO?</h3>
                        <p>Citations are one of the main factors that search engines use when ranking businesses on local search results. They allow you to either rank up or down on the search engine results pages (SERPs) for local queries. If many websites
                            reference your NAP on theirs, you’ll likely move up on the rankings.</p>
                        <p>This is especially true if the websites where the business is mentioned are relevant to its niche. Additionally, citations are used by search engines to corroborate businesses’ contact information.
                        </p>
                        <p>But citations are not only important because of their effect on your business’s local rankings, but they also help increase the chances of people finding you online. If you are selling a product, this translates to more people
                            finding you and increasing your conversion rate.</p>
                        <p>If you own a small business, you could be the first one on the SERPs for local searches if your website is referenced many times on business directories and other industry-relevant websites.
                        </p>
                        <p>Here are some examples of other local citations you probably didn’t know about:</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; Forum pages</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; Question and answer</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; Forums</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; Geo/Industry-Specific Platforms</p>
                        <p>Press releases</p>
                        <p>Even though citations are good for your website’s ranking and discoverability, they can also have negative impacts. Google takes into consideration three factors: the number of citations your website has, the accuracy of these
                            citations, and the quality of the platforms they are in. When these are inconsistent or low-quality, Google can simply ignore them. Making your ranking stay where it is or in some cases, go down.</p>

                    <h3>What is Client-side and Server-side rendering?</h3>
                    <div class="insights-data-inner custom-scroll">
                        <p>Client-side and server-side are terms that web developers use to specify in which application the code runs.</p>
                        <p>In the client-server model, users’ devices communicate through a network of centrally located servers. Devices such as laptops, smartphones, etc., are considered ‘clients’ in this scenario. So, the ’clients’ are the ones who request
                            the servers to load a specific website or application.</p>
                        <p>Client-side refers to the information that’s displayed on the users’ devices. This information is exactly what the user sees, like text, images, etc. Client-side rendering takes place on the browser and is done by JavaScript. So,
                            when people request a website, they don’t receive the information directly from HTML content. Instead, they obtain a bare HTML document alongside a JavaScript. The javaScript does the rendering on the browser.</p>
                        <p>Initially, client-side rendering can be slow, since the browser hast to make several requests to the server to acquire the information. But, thanks to the JavaScript framework, whenever you want to load the same webpage again,
                            is going to be exponentially faster.</p>
                        <p>Client-side rendering with JavaScript makes it harder for Search Engines to crawl and index a site’s content. Consequently, Search Engine Optimization (SEO) can suffer. The content must be correctly rendered, indexed, and ranked
                            in the search engine results page for the SEO to be effective. This is not always the case with client-side rendering websites.</p>
                        <p>In contrast, server-side rendering is when all the HTML is rendered in the server, instead of the users’ devices. This conversion of data takes a few milliseconds. It depends on various factors such as internet speed, the server’s
                            location, how many users are trying to access the site, and whether the website is optimized or not. When using server-side rendering, SEO efforts are more effective. The process is much easier without using JavaScript, and
                            crawlers can index the content more accurately.</p>

                <div class="insights-data" data-info="What is Cloaking?">
                    <h3>What is Cloaking?</h3>
                    <div class="insights-data-inner custom-scroll">
                        <p>Cloaking&nbsp;is an SEO technique where the content or information presented to users is different from that presented to search engine crawlers. This can be done for two reasons: for better indexing and to lead users to pages
                            that they were not looking for. Cloaking is also implemented to mislead search engines into giving a site a higher ranking and promoting spam.</p>
                        <h3>The use of cloaking in the SEO community</h3>
                        <p>This method is very debatable. Knowing what cloaking is, this strategy could be considered illegal, depending on your intentions.</p>
                        <p>Black hat cloaking, on the one hand, is used as a ruse to trick search engines into ranking sites for search queries that have nothing to do with what will be shown to users and to drive traffic to deceitful or spammy websites.
                            If you are found out, Google can remove your site from its index.</p>
                        <p>White hat cloaking, on the other hand, is when people use the technique because it is the right thing to do, or so they think. The term applies to websites that don’t have the intention of misleading bots or users. These sites
                            use cloaking to provide a better user experience or to help search engines index a page more accurately.
                        </p>
                        <h3>When is cloaking OK?</h3>
                        <p>When necessary, certain types of content can be cloaked. Some of them are:</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; Invisible or hidden text. Sometimes, people can add additional text or keywords in order to stand out. By cloaking this, the information becomes invisible to the user but remains useful for crawlers.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; E-mail cloaking. When you don’t want your personal information appearing on emails, cloaking is a way to do it.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; HTML rich websites. This can be used mostly in small blogs, where the text to HTML source code ratio is low. People choose to use the cloaking method in order to meet the SEO guidelines.
                        </p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; Image Gallery Websites. Since bots are unable to crawl and index images, people often cloak them to increase their ranking.</p>

                    <h3>What are Commercial Investigation Queries?</h3>
                    <div class="insights-data-inner custom-scroll">
                        <p>Internet searches are always done with a purpose in mind. It can be looking for general information, information about products or services, or searching for something to buy or sell, etc. &nbsp;The string of words that users enter
                            into search engine search boxes to find such information is called a search query. A search query can have four primary intents: navigational, informational, transactional, and commercial investigation.</p>
                        <p>Informational queries are typed when users want to find information about something in particular. They would type in terms such as “G¡raffe,” or “what to do during a long layover in New York.”</p>
                        <p>Navigational queries are used when the searcher wants to find a particular website. For example, they’d Google ‘Yelp or ‘TripAdvisor.’</p>
                        <p>Transactional queries are those that are typed for purchasing purposes.</p>
                        <p>Commercial investigation queries are those done by a searcher who wants to compare a product or a service to find which one is best for them.</p>
                        <p>A commercial investigation query search can be done only for the purpose of research or with the intention to purchase. Some examples of commercial investigation queries include:</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; Looking for providers of raw materials</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; Searching for a distribution partner for a product you are launching</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; Finding the best manufacturer of reusable bags in a specific area</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; Researching the best travel insurance provider for an upcoming trip</p>
                        <p>These searches are not directly transactional and do not necessarily result in a purchase or any other commercial relationship. However, they are also not purely informational.</p>
                        <p>When you run a business, your competitors should play a significant role in your marketing decisions. These types of queries can provide valuable information when searching for potential clients/partners, options for future transactions,
                            assessing your competitors, and choosing keywords to optimize your site for search engines. As such, they play a key role when doing keyword research for SEO. In fact, many experts claim that when choosing target keywords,
                            it is more important to focus on searcher intent than on search volume.</p>

                    <div class="insights-data-inner custom-scroll">
                        <p>As the name suggests, competitor analysis is the method used when you want to know what your competitors look like, what their strengths and weaknesses are, and how you can exploit the latter. If they are outranking you, what are
                            the reasons for this, how they drive traffic, etc. This analysis can help you get insights into what strategies work for others in your industry, and how you can improve on them and adapt them to your business.
                        </p>
                        <p>There are many ways for you to accomplish this. You just need to look in the right direction and keep track of your competitors’ websites, features, content, and social media marketing strategy.
                        </p>
                        <p>The first thing to do is to identify your biggest SEO competitors. Are they the same as last year? Have new ones appeared since then? What do their websites look like? It doesn’t matter if some of them are not in your niche. The
                            thing you need to look for is keywords. If other sites rank higher than you when you enter the keywords you are targeting; they are considered your competitors.</p>
                        <p>If this is the case, then you need to adopt a keyword optimization approach. Study how they use the keywords and see how you can improve on their strategy. Studying your competitor’s SEO can give you the upper hand. You need to
                            learn everything about them: how often they publish content, which keywords they are targeting, and what type of content they work with.</p>
                        <p>Other aspects of competitor analysis include reviewing site responsiveness, loading speed, and user experience. It is no secret that a mobile-friendly or responsive site will rank better than one that is not. It is also well-known
                            that site loading speed is an important ranking factor for search engines. If your site is slow and unresponsive when compared to your competitors’, then look at their site structure and how the approach user experience. Then,
                            go to your website and run an analysis to see where you can optimize it.</p>
                        <p>Lastly, you can investigate how they are using social media. Maybe they are more efficient than you in this aspect. Improve your social media game and track your progress. This way, you can start your social media optimization

                    <div class="insights-data-inner custom-scroll">
                        <p>Content, or web content, refers to all the information available on your website. Well-written content will always attract people and keep them engaged. It’s also a way for you to gain and keep your readers’ trust and establish
                            a relationship.</p>
                        <h3>What is SEO content?</h3>
                        <p>SEO stands for Search Engine Optimization. It’s the practice of increasing both the quality and quantity of website traffic through organic search engine results. Thus, SEO content is basically any content that has been created
                            to generate search engine traffic.</p>
                        <p>There are a few things to keep in mind when creating SEO content:</p>
                        <p><strong>Keyword research.</strong> This is the first step to publishing content that generates traffic. Keyword research will provide insights into what keywords to use on your website according to your niche. Familiarize yourself
                            with the common keywords people use to find your product or service, and make a list of possible keywords to use, keeping in mind your topic and business. When deciding which keywords you want to target, you need to take search
                            volume, competition, and searcher intent into account.</p>
                        <p><strong>Keyword optimization.</strong> You need to know how to maximize the efficiency of your keywords. Keep them updated as your target audience evolves, and know where and how to use them in order to get higher rankings.</p>
                        <p><strong>Content organization.</strong> You need to structure your content logically and pleasingly. This is important for both SEO and if you want to attract and keep visitors as engaged as possible. Make use of headers and sub-headings
                            to separate the information and guide your readers through a page or even to other pages on your site.</p>
                        <p><strong>Content promotion. </strong>Promote your website using social media platforms, sharing it with your friends/partners, or guest posting. You could also invest in online advertisement such as pay-per-click (PPC) o pay-per-impression
                            (PPI).
                        </p>
                        <p>There are many types of SEO content; these include product pages, blog posts, articles, lists, guides, videos, infographics, slideshows, glossaries, and so on. All of these are opportunities for you to showcase your what you have
                            to offer, and make sure it gets found by capitalizing on search engine optimization techniques. The possibilities are endless, and each type of content can bring something different to the table.</p>

                    <div class="insights-data-inner custom-scroll">
                        <p>A content management system, or CMS, is an application people use to manage content. The information is stored in a database, and it is accessible to everyone. The basic features of CMS are content creation, content storage, workflow
                            management, and publishing.</p>
                        <p>WordPress is the most popular content management system, but there are others available:</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; Drupal</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; Joomla</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; Magento</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; ModX</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; Squarespace</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; Wix</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; Weebly</p>
                        <h3>Advantages of content management systems</h3>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; They are collaborative, location-independent tools. Users across the world can contribute to create, edit, and optimize the content managed through a CMS. They can be accessed anywhere, and in some cases, even from
                            various mobile devices thanks to their user-friendly interfaces.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; Since it doesn’t rely much on HTML and CSS, CMS can be understood by people from any background. Someone doesn’t have to be a programmer in order to create content using CMS.
                        </p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; Content management system also uses administrators. They are responsible for setting the boundaries of who can write, edit, or publish content. CMSs are SEO friendly, and it even allow you to install some plugins
                            for optimization.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Disadvantages of content management systems</h3>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; They can be vulnerable to hackers. Hackers can take advantage of the fact that CMSS are typically free and accessible to anyone. However, you can take some actions to prevent hacking as much as possible. Some of
                            these measures include keeping your plugins updated and opting for two-factor authentication access.
                        </p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; They can affect loading speed. CMS platforms can cause low speed or lagging on your website, so using a good caching plugin is essential. The plugin will load the site faster for repeated users by remembering the
                            previously requested HTML.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; You might have to learn some HTML. Depending on what you want to achieve, you might still need to know some HTML. Although knowing HTML and CSS is not necessary to use a CMS, sometimes your posts don’t look exactly
                            how you envisioned them, or you want something different that can’t be obtained using the features available by default on the CMS.</p>

                        <p>Content marketing is the strategic creation of text, imagery, audio, or video, that delivers a relevant and compelling message to customers or prospects while paving the way for a sale. This strategy is being used by 86% of businesses
                            today.
                        </p>
                        <p>There are three significant advantages of a thought-out content marketing strategy: it can increase your sales, reduce costs, and help you gain better and more loyal customers.</p>
                        <h3>Elements for an effective content marketing strategy</h3>
                        <p>Content marketing plays a crucial role in search engine optimization (SEO). It is one of the pillars any SEO strategy you want to implement as search engines recognize businesses that constantly publish highly valuable, relevant
                            content.
                        </p>
                        <p>However, not all strategies for content generation work. If you don’t provide value-added content, then it won’t help your business grow. Take into consideration the following elements for a more effective content marketing strategy.
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Define your target market. </strong>You need to know exactly who you are creating content for (those people who would be interested or could be persuaded to buy your products or services). Some experts recommend creating
                            buyer personas. This is a representation of your ideal customer.</p>
                        <p>Buyer personas are created based on market research and data about a business’s existing customers. You should include your customers’ demographics, motivations, goals, behavioral patterns, and other data that you consider relevant.
                            The more details you include in constructing these characters, the better.</p>
                        <p><strong>Create quality content regularly.</strong> The next step is giving your audience what they want. Create content that is relevant and engaging and present it in an imaginative way (especially if your topic is considered
                            boring for most people). Cater to their needs and choose what you publish accordingly. Use your content to demonstrate authority within your niche, and include compelling calls-to-action to increase conversions.</p>
                        <p>Content creation and publishing should not be done randomly. If you want your content marketing campaign to bear fruits, most of the pieces should be planned out. Every article you publish should be informative, entertaining, engaging,
                            and relevant, and always provide value to your customers and prospects.</p>
                        <p><strong>Optimize your content. </strong>While your content should be created to meet your target audience’s needs, it needs to be structured, so it is easily crawled and indexed by search engines. You can do this with content optimization.
                            A few basic tips for content optimization include:</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; The keyword you want to target should be included in your title and throughout the text, but not in excess. Use keywords and their variants naturally. Be sure to include LSI keywords as well.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; Make use of header tags to organize your content.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; Use your keyword in the page’s URL and in the first hundred words of the text.
                        </p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; Include both outbound and inbound links. Outbound links should come from reputable sources in your niche.</p>
                        <p><strong>Monitor, analyze, and report</strong>. It’s essential that you measure the results of each post. This will allow you to understand what type of content your audience is more prone to enjoying and which channels are the
                            best to distribute it. Once you have gathered enough data, you can tweak your campaign to improve its success.</p>

                    <h3>What is Content Syndication?</h3>
                    <div class="insights-data-inner custom-scroll">
                        <p>Content syndication is a win-win situation between you and third-party websites, where your content is re-published by other people. This allows other sites to generate more traffic and showcase a specific piece of information
                            that may be useful to their customers, for free. For you, it means an increase in visitors thanks to the backlinks you get. Any content can be syndicated: blog posts, articles, infographics, and images.</p>
                        <p>The effectiveness of content syndication depends on what your business is about and what you want to achieve. Its benefits include:</p>
                        <p><strong>Boost brand awareness or followers increase on social media.</strong> This can be achieved through social media syndication.</p>
                        <p><strong>Maximize the use of your content</strong>. If you have fantastic content but limited traffic, content syndication is a scalable way to gain exposure. &nbsp;Strategically choosing in which websites you want your content
                            syndicated is crucial. Ideally, you would want your content to be on sites more authoritative than yours. That way, when it’s linked back to your website, you can attract more people, generate traffic fast, and get some of
                            the link juice in the process.</p>
                        <p><strong>Gain backlinks.</strong> And with them, increase your site’s authority and trustworthiness.
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Increased lead generation. </strong>If you choose carefully where to syndicate your content, you get get a lot more qualified leads.</p>
                        <p>On paper, this looks like a perfect SEO strategy. However, this is not always the case. Content syndication has a few drawbacks, which include:</p>
                        <p><strong>Syndicated post outranking your post.</strong> This is not necessarily a bad thing; you could still get leads from the links to your site on the third-party site.</p>
                        <p><strong>Duplicate content issues.</strong> Search engines, Google especially, have made it clear that they frown upon content duplication.</p>
                        <p><strong>Inability to grow your mailing list.</strong> Most sites that publish syndicated content don’t allow authors to include a mail opt-in to their website. This means you can gain a lot of exposure through syndication but won’t
                            be able to grow your email list from it.</p>
                        <p>An essential part of content syndication is establishing communication between you and third parties. Researching about where you should have your content published to gain the most out of it is the first step to a successful strategy.
                            This will allow you to tailor and master your pitching and get your pieces accepted quickly.

                <div class="insights-data" data-info="What is Conversion?">
                    <h3>What is Conversion?</h3>
                    <div class="insights-data-inner custom-scroll">
                        <p>Conversion is when site visitors take specific actions that were intended by the site owner (site goals). These actions include making a purchase, filling out a contact form, subscribing to an email newsletter, or others. It is
                            said that a user has ‘converted’ when that person goes from being a visitor to a buyer or fixed customer.</p>
                        <p>One of the most important aspects of conversion rate optimization is calls-to-action (CTAs). They are prompts that tell users to take decisive actions regarding your business or product. When a website has a clear call-to-action
                            that leads users to different conclusions, the conversion rate will definitely be higher. Having ‘Sign Up’ or ‘Subscribe’ buttons all over your website’s pages is an excellent way for customers to pay attention and click on
                            it. Filling out forms or calling a number displayed on the site, is also considered as a conversion. Something as easy as opening an email can go a long way for the conversion rate of the website.</p>
                        <p>In marketing, site traffic alone is not enough to evaluate how successful a website is. To measure the efficiency of the website, the advertisements, and the SEO, a conversion rate is estimated. This is the number of times a visitor
                            takes a desired action divided by the overall number of visitors. You can optimize to maximize conversion rate.</p>
                        <p>Since conversion and conversion rate are essential for quantifying whether the business is doing good or not, it is crucial to understand your audience. Empathizing with your readers and learning their problems, and most importantly,
                            show them how you can help fix them. These actions will allow customers to get engaged and ultimately, convert into a buyer or regular customer. Social media also plays a large role in this process. Attracting followers is
                            a great way to drive traffic to your website and boost your business growth.</p>

                    <h3>What is Conversion Rate?</h3>
                    <div class="insights-data-inner custom-scroll">
                        <p>Conversion rate is used to quantify the number of users that convert on your website. When a user converts, it means that the person went from being just a visitor to an actual customer or buyer.
                        </p>
                        <p>The rate is specified as a ratio that needs to be multiplied by 100 after knowing how many users converted. Therefore, this ratio is always shown as a percentage.</p>
                        <p>For a better understanding of how to measure conversion rate, take this example:</p>
                        <p>Imagine you own a fitness website that gets 3,000 visitors monthly. Your ultimate goal is that those who come to your website buy your fitness program. The moment when a person makes the purchase would be considered as the site’s
                            user conversion. Now, let’s say that 40 of the visitors who came to your website on month X bought the program. Only the number of visitors or users who actually make a purchase or take decisive action on your website can be
                            considered as a conversion.</p>
                        <p>Then, the conversion rate is calculated as follows:</p>
                        <p>40 purchases / 3,000 visitors * 100 = 1.33 %. That 1,33% would be your conversion rate for a given month.</p>
                        <p>Whether that number is good or bad depends on various factors: The type of conversion (subscribing to a newsletter, making a purchase, etc.), what industry you are on, and what you are offering, etc. Usually, when the website runs
                            on a particular niche, conversion rates can be higher. The average internet conversion rate is about 2,5%.</p>
                        <p>To make sure your conversion rate is as good as it can be, you need to set goals. They need to be realistic and reflect what you want to achieve with your business.</p>

                    <h3>What is Conversion Rate Optimization?</h3>
                    <div class="insights-data-inner custom-scroll">
                        <p>Conversion rate optimization (CRO) consists of modifying your website to increase its conversion rate. Traffic is the most crucial element for conversion rate improvement. High-quality traffic will eventually turn into fixed customers
                            or buyers. The second factor is content. Is the site’s copy good enough? Are your landing pages compelling? Did you include powerful calls-to-action? These are the questions that need to be answered in order to get a sense
                            of what to improve to boost your site’s conversions.</p>
                        <p>Some other factors that influence the CRO are:</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; Loading speed. This is very important. The webpage needs to be able to load fast, so the user doesn’t get distracted and leave. The faster it loads, the higher the chances users will convert.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; Content marketing. As stated before, content is significant. A well-thought-out content marketing strategy can go a long way to increase a website’s CRO.
                        </p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; &nbsp;If you are operating an online shop, then having a user-friendly basket is vital. Sometimes, the ‘add to cart’ process, and the subsequent purchase is confusing. This will lead to a decrease in the conversion
                            rate. Having a certificate of trust or money-back guarantee can be beneficial too, as this will instill confidence in your visitors.</p>
                        <p>Ideally, you should run tests on various versions of your site (A/B testing). Here, two or more variations of a website go live and receive random traffic. This is done to evaluate, which performs better. &nbsp;Factors such as
                            color palette, design, layout, and others., are taken into consideration. “A” corresponds to the control website and B to its variation. This method can be a potent tool to test how effective your website, make improvements,
                            and adjust your CRO and SEO strategies based on real data.</p>

                        <p>Cornerstone content is one of the foundations of your website and some of the most pivotal pages on it. With this type of content, you will stand out from your competitors and become authoritative in the eyes of search engines.
                            You should aim for cornerstone content to rank for the most competitive keywords relevant to your business.</p>
                        <h3>What counts as cornerstone content?</h3>
                        <p>It is the most relevant and pivotal content of your website. It’s how you show new visitors, prospective customers, and search engines what you have to offer.</p>
                        <p>Cornerstone articles, blog posts, or pages are generally long-form (+2500 words) and tend to be structured like guides. They should provide in-depth insights on key topics for your niche, and you should be able to draw many sub-topics
                            from your cornerstone posts.</p>
                        <h3>What elements make a great cornerstone page?</h3>
                        <p>Putting all the information described above into a page is no guarantee that it will attract more users. The material needs to be crafted perfectly, and using these elements is a sure way to achieve it.</p>
                        <p>– Keywords. Researching the keywords you can use on your website for your niche is a fundamental process. Cornerstone content should aim to rank for your primary keywords and the ones where competition is higher. It should also
                            be optimized for those keywords. This is very important if you want to be indexed and rank on search engines.</p>
                        <p>– Craft a killer piece. Try to solve your target audience’s problem or answer their question regarding the topic. Be concise and clear, mentioning the solution right off the bat. The body of your cornerstone content is essential.</p>
                        <p>– Include inbound and outbound links. Think of your cornerstone content as the central train station. It’s the hub from where visitors can travel to other pages or posts on your site with ease. Make sure also to include outbound
                            links for authoritative sites or relevant information that could help the user understand your website better. Include additional features like images, videos, infographics, etc. to help convey the message.</p>
                        <p>– A wonderful conclusion. Don’t forget that while this content is informative, you are trying to sell a product or service. Don’t be afraid to include calls-to-action throughout the text and at the end. This is your most powerful
                            tool to attain conversions. Make the conclusion engaging and give the final push for customers to convert.</p>

                    <div class="insights-data-inner custom-scroll">
                        <p>Cost per acquisition (CPA) is a financial term used in marketing to measure how much is the total cost of acquiring one paying customer on a campaign. By tracking this, business owners can know how much revenue they received when
                            purchasing that advertisement.</p>
                        <p>Most marketers prefer this pricing model because it lets them set a goal of acquisition before paying for a marketing campaign. So, they only pay when that desired goal of purchase is met. Some marketing mediums that use CPA are
                            pay-per-click (PPC), affiliate, display, social media, and content marketing.</p>
                        <p>So, how do you calculate the cost per acquisition?</p>
                        <p>To calculate the CPA, you need to take the total amount you spend on advertising and divide it by the numbers of acquisitions (sale, click, or form submission) generated.</p>
                        <h3>How can CPA be optimized?</h3>
                        <p>Writing amazing copy and ads is the ultimate way of increasing the cost per acquisition. This is done by implementing a well-planned content marketing strategy. This should generate significant traffic and attract customers by
                            sharing valuable and relevant content. A website that provides value-added content will stand out and have users that are there to stay.</p>
                        <p>Create an offer that is interesting and clear. It is also helpful if you leave some things to the imagination of your readers. Let them be curious. Take into consideration your audience’s emotions instead. Know what drives them,
                            what they love, and hate. Do your research and show how much you care about their problems and feelings.</p>
                        <p>Invest in UX website design. Let the layout be simple and easy to understand. Create compelling headlines and sub-headlines to grab your audience’s attention.</p>
                        <p>Finally, be more interested in conversion instead of clicks. Sometimes, clicking doesn’t mean staying. Pay attention to what your conversion rate is and work to improve your site accordingly.
                        </p>
                        <h3>How can I track CPA?</h3>

                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; Use promotional codes and customized links for an internal campaign.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; Use UTM parameters to track your social- and affiliate-marketing-generated traffic.

                            clicks, then the CPC would be $5.66. That $5.66 is the result of 300/53.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Devising a successful pay-per-click campaign can be challenging, but it is not impossible. The easiest way to ensure you get what you pay for is to follow a top-down approach and adjust the elements of paid search accordingly.
                            These include:
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>A strategic marketing campaign.</strong> A paid search marketing campaign can contain different ad groups. You could take advantage of specific dates of the year to launch different groups. For example, for a Father’s Day
                            Sale, Christmas, Cyber Monday, etc. Each of those dates represents an opportunity to maximize the success of your PPC campaign.</p>
                        <p><strong>Ad groups</strong>. These keep you organized. The most efficient way of using them is creating several ad groups for your merchandise. See which of them attract more people and work around them. Study their relevance and
                            keep improving your ads.</p>
                        <p><strong>Ads. </strong>These are what users will see on search engines or websites. You want to optimize your ads so that they drive the highest amount of qualified traffic to your site.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Optimizing &nbsp;CPC</h3>
                        <p>Optimizing cost-per-click will highly depend on where you plan to run your PPC campaign. In the case of Google, carefully choosing your keywords is essential for your ads to be shown to exactly the people looking for your product
                            or service. Take advantage of long-tail keywords and use negative keywords so that your ads are shown to your intended target market.</p>
                        <p>If you plan to advertise on social media, then you need to segment your ads correctly.</p>
                        <p>Having advertisements alone is not enough. The ad copy, which is the message written on the ads, needs to be carefully crafted. Consider your target audience and keep in mind three things: features, benefits, and calls-to-action.</p>
                        <p>Having a user click on your ad is half the work. This will give you a chance to convince them you have exactly what they need. Here’s where landing pages come into play.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Landing pages are created for the sole purpose of a marketing or advertisement campaign. It is where customers ‘arrive’ when they click on an ad. They must be built with purpose, to maximize conversion rate.</p>

                    <h3>What is Cost-per-Thousand Impressions?</h3>
                    <div class="insights-data-inner custom-scroll">
                        <p>Cost-per-thousand impression (CPM) or cost per mile, represents the total amount an advertiser pays for 1,000 impressions on their page. If a publisher charges $4.00 CPM, then the advertiser must pay $4 for every 1,000 clicks of
                            the ad.
                        </p>
                        <h3>CPM vs. CPA vs. CPC</h3>
                        <p>Cost per mile (CPM) is one of the most used pricing models for online advertisement. There are other popular models such as cost-per-click (CPC) and cost-per-acquisition (CPA). In CPC, the site owner pays every time a user clicks
                            on an ad while in CPA, the advertiser pays only when the visitor makes a purchase.</p>
                        <p>If your campaign focus is directed to a niche audience making a purchase, cost-per-click (CPC) or cost-per-acquisition (CPA) are more convenient price models for your business.</p>
                        <p>Cost per thousand impressions (CPM), on the other hand, is a better method for businesses interested in creating or boosting brand awareness or expanding, promoting a new product, or for those products with already large markets</p>
                        <p>CPM is also used for people who want to develop or already have mobile apps. In this case, a couple of factors need to be considered before making any decision.</p>
                        <p>Anything from a banner ad to a pop up is considered as impressions. Imagine all the times you are on your phone playing a game or using an app, and an ad appears, or there is one at the top or bottom of the screen. All these advertisements
                            add up as impressions and will be counted for the CPM calculation.</p>
                        <p>It’s important to note that you shouldn’t expect to see the revenue right away. This process can be slow, and the results can be best appreciated in the long run.</p>
                        <h2>What is Crawl Budget?</h2>
                        <p>Crawl budget the number of pages on a website crawled and indexed by a search engine in any given period. Since search engines have limited resources, they need a way to prioritize websites and, they do this by assigning crawling
                            budgets.
                        </p>
                        <p>But first, what exactly is crawling?</p>
                        <p>Crawling is the process of acquiring data on a website. The entities who perform this task are called crawlers. They are also known as spiders or bots. They gather information about sites by scanning them. They tend to browse titles,
                            images, keywords, links, etc.</p>
                        <p>Crawlers check a site’s robots.txt to know what they’re allowed to crawl. Then each URL is scanned individually. New pages to crawl are usually discovered by search engines through links (that’ why inbound links are so important).
                            Another way that crawlers know where to go is through sitemap submissions: when a website owner lets search engines know there’s a new site or page to crawl.</p>
                        <h3>How do crawlers assign crawling budgets?</h3>
                        <p>There are two factors that crawlers take into consideration when selecting the websites to crawl.
                        </p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; Crawl rate limit. This translates to how much crawling a website can handle. For Googlebot, this is represented by the number of simultaneous connections it uses to crawl a site. The time it must wait between fetches
                            is also measured. This rate can be high or low depending on two things: crawl health and the limit set in the Search Console.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; – Crawl demand. This is the selection of URLs that are worthy of crawling. If there is no demand for indexing, the activity of Googlebot will be low. The bot searches for two factors: URL popularity and staleness. When an
                            URL is very popular on the internet, it tends to get crawled more often. By crawling this URL, it allows websites to maintain fresh and amongst the top rankings. However, Googlebot also keeps an eye on for less popular URLs
                            and crawls them to prevent them from going stale.</p>
                        <p>Having a low-quality URL can affect your site’s crawling and indexing. If you have duplicated content or have been recently hacked, this will have an impact on your crawl budget</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div class="insights-data" data-info="What are Crawl Directives?">
                    <h3>What are Crawl Directives?</h3>
                    <div class="insights-data-inner custom-scroll">
                        <p>The most common crawl directive is called ‘Robots Meta Directives,’ also known as ‘meta tags.’ These tags serve as guidelines for crawlers, so they know how to crawl or index your site. Another directive is the robots.txt file;
                            This is a file that serves the same purpose as meta tags. These guidelines are read by search engines and, depending on what you want them to do, they act.</p>
                        <p>However, the crawlers or bots may not always respond to instructions. Since they are not programmed to follow these rules strictly, it is possible that they sometimes will ignore the code.
                        </p>
                        <p>Depending on your necessity, some of those instructions (as code form) can be:</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; noindex: it tells the bots not to index a page.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; index: this is the default instruction, and it means that the crawler can index the page.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; dofollow: this tells the crawler to follow the page and its links even if it’s not indexed.
                        </p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; nofollow: it tells the bot a link should not be considered when indexing the page where it is.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; noimageindex: it tells the crawler to not index any images on the site.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; none: it refers to ‘noindex and ‘nofollow’ simultaneously.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; noarchive: search engines should not show a cached link to this page on a SERP (search engine results page).</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; &nbsp;nocache: is the same as noarchive but only works on Internet Explorer and Firefox.
                        </p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; Unavailable after: it tells the crawlers that after a specific date, they shouldn’t index the website.</p>

                    <h3>What is Critical Rendering Path?</h3>
                    <div class="insights-data-inner custom-scroll">
                        <p>The critical rending path (CRP) is a series of events that take place in order to render (display) the initial view of the website. For it to happen, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files need to be analyzed. The necessary steps involved
                            in rendering include: ‘constructing the object model,’ ‘constructing and painting the layout,’ and ‘adding interactivity with JavaScript.’</p>
                        <p>This process is essential, as it determines the speed in which your webpage loads. It is commonly known that your website speed is critical when a search engine determines SERPs rankings. The faster the speed, the higher the ranking,
                            the higher the ranking, the higher the traffic. Site loading speed is also important once a visitor reaches your site. It can affect site conversion and bounce rates. Critical rendering path is sometimes optimized to drop a
                            couple of loading seconds off your site. Every second that is reduced from your site’s speed is a win.</p>
                        <h3>How to optimize the critical rendering path?</h3>
                        <p>To optimize the critical rendering path, taking these few steps are the way to go:</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; Analyze your website and find the key resources that are necessary for the initial view.
                        </p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; Since the page loads its above-the-fold content first, you can remove or defer elements that are not required for this step.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; Reduce the page size as much as possible by compressing and optimizing resources.
                        </p>
                        <p> – Images. Some example of resources you can compress or optimize on your webpage include:
                        </p>
                        <p> – Concentrate only on a few pictures and not the total amount of the ones you have on your site. Pick only the images that are critical and need to be visible in the above-the-fold content.
                        </p>
                        <p> – JavaScript files. Work the JavaScript files the same way as images: choose the data that will appear at the top of the page first.</p>
                        <p> – CSS files. Try and make your CSS document as small as possible. Optimize it to achieve a slower rendering time.</p>
                    </div>

                <div class="insights-data" data-info="What is Cross-linking?">
                    <h3>What is Cross-linking?</h3>
                    <div class="insights-data-inner custom-scroll">
                        <p>Cross-linking is the process of linking between two websites. It can be done by either linking another site you own or a third-party website. It is done to show content that is similar to yours or that you think your audience would
                            like to read.</p>
                        <h3>How does cross-linking benefits SEO?</h3>
                        <p>This method can be handy for SEO strategies. It helps you attract more traffic and rank higher on the search engine results page (SERP).</p>
                        <p>When you use this strategy within your site pages, cross-linking can be an excellent way to make visitors stay for a more extended period on your site. Thus, improving the way search engines index your pages.</p>
                        <p>When done right, cross-lining can:</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; Enhance the relevancy of your site’s pages.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; Help search engines better understand what your website is about.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; –&nbsp; Improve the perceived authority for some of your page’s in the eyes of search engines.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Dos and don’ts of Cross-linking</h3>
                        <p>Don’t include a link to the same site on every page for two reasons: it can be a red flag for bots, and it dilutes link quality.</p>
                        <p>Don’t create a “link ring.” This is when various sites link to one another but don’t include links to other sites. This practice can get you penalized in a heartbeat.</p>
                        <p>DO use keyword-rich anchor text when cross-linking. This will provide more and better information to crawlers.</p>
                        <p>Follow these tips for a successful cross-linking strategy. Be sure to track how it performs and use data to finetune your strategy. &nbsp;Being successful at cross-linking can put your website amongst the highest-ranking sites
                            in your niche.

                <div class="insights-data" data-info="What is Curated Content?">
                    <h3>What is Curated Content?</h3>
                    <div class="insights-data-inner custom-scroll">
                        <p>When you have curated content on your website or social media channels, it means that you have picked pieces created by others, added your own voice and value to share with your audience. Content curation is a powerful strategy
                            and can result in many follower gains in no time.</p>
                        <p>Immersing yourself in your audience and their needs is the first step to sharing relevant curated content. Doing your research and knowing precisely what your customers or prospects need and crave is a vital part of content curation.
                            Find different sources and place them strategically on all your channels.</p>
                        <p>The sources don’t need to be limited to links to other pages. Get creative and share videos, images, and articles. Anything that is innovative and will keep your audience engaged.</p>
                        <h3>How can I succeed as a content curator?</h3>
                        <p><strong>Know your audience. </strong>Content curation is all about your target audience. So, even if you find content that is interesting to you, it doesn’t mean they want to see it. The content you curate needs to be helpful and
                            interesting to them. Before deciding to share it, ask yourself the following questions:</p>
                        <p>How would this help my audience?</p>
                        <p>Is it from a trustworthy source?</p>
                        <p>Is it worth sharing? Unique enough?</p>
                        <p>How will they feel when they read/see it?</p>
                        <p><strong>Build your brand awareness before sharing curated content.</strong> You need to establish authority and trust. If you are a newcomer, this could be challenging. Promote yourself and let them know you are for real. Give
                            them reasons to confide in you and pick you.</p>
                        <p><strong>Make it personal. </strong>Deliver content that is personal and unusual to your readers. Don’t just throw any link or content out there. When possible include stories about relatable figures, but add a touch of your own
                            to it.
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Study the content before sharing.</strong> Make sure that the information you are giving your audience is to their liking and, most importantly, that it will solve one or many of their problems. Sharing valuable and high-quality
                            content is crucial.</p>
                        <p><strong>Stay away from promotions and ads.</strong> Don’t try and push products on your audience. But, in case you must do it, pick products that align with their needs and interests. Only advertise products in which you have confidence
                            and know they will be beneficial for them.</p>
